<h1 title="">NAN OF THE GYPSIES</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">GYPSY NAN.</span></h2>
<p>One glorious autumn day, when the pale mellow
gold of the sunshine softened the ruggedness of the
encircling mountains and lay caressingly on the
gnarled live oaks, on the sky-reaching eucalyptus,
and on the red-berried pepper trees, a tinkling of
bells was heard on the long highway that led into
the little garden village of San Seritos, half asleep
by the gleaming blue Pacific. A gypsy caravan,
consisting of three covered wagons drawn by teams
of six mules, and followed by a string of horses,
drew to one side of the road and stopped. A band
of nut-brown, fox-like children scrambled down and
began to race about, the older ones gathering sticks
for the camp fire which they knew would soon be
needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Four men, aquiline nosed, and with black hair
hanging in ringlets to their shoulders, and as many
women, gaudily dressed, with red and yellow silk
handkerchiefs wound about their heads, prepared to
make camp for the night.</p>
<p>It was a fittingly picturesque spot for a clump of
gnarled live oaks grew about a spring of clear, cold
water, which, fed from some hidden source, was
never dry.</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile away lay the first of the beautiful
estates and homes of Spanish architecture, for
which San Seritos was far famed.</p>
<p>One of the gypsy women paused at her task to
shade her eyes and gaze back over the highway as
though expecting someone.</p>
<p>A mis-shapen goblin-like boy tugged on her sleeve,
and with a wistful expression in his dark eyes, he
whispered, &ldquo;Manna Lou, Nan hasn&rsquo;t run away again,
has she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo; no,&rdquo; the gypsy answered, drearily. &ldquo;Maybe
yes and maybe not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, when the woman had returned to
her task, there was a screaming of delight among the
fox-like children, and Tirol, the mis-shapen boy,
cried in a thrill glad voice, &ldquo;Here she comes, Manna
Lou! Here comes Gypsy Nan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Toward them down the mountain drive, galloping
on a spirited mottled pony, rode a beautiful
young girl of thirteen, her long black hair, straight
to her shoulders, suddenly broke into a riot of ringlets
and hung to her waist. Her gown and headdress
were as bright as maple leaves in Autumn, and her
dark brown eyes were laughing with merriment and
mischief.</p>
<p>As she sprang from her pony, the gypsy children
leaped upon her, uttering animal-like cries of joy,
but Tirol, hobbling to her side, caught her warm
brown hand in his thin claw-like one and looked up
at her with adoration in his hungering black eyes as
he said: &ldquo;I was &rsquo;fraid, Sister Nan, &rsquo;fraid you had
gone again, and maybe this time for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gypsy girl knelt impulsively and caught the
mis-shapen boy in her arms, and her eyes flashed as
she said passionately: &ldquo;Little Tirol, Nan will never,
never go for good as long as you need her to protect
you from that wicked Anselo Spico. I hate
him, hate him, because he abuses a poor boy who
can&rsquo;t grow strong and defend himself, but he won&rsquo;t
strike you again, little Tirol, unless he strikes me
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; warningly whispered Cyra, a small gypsy
girl. &ldquo;Here comes Spico. He&rsquo;s been ahead to look
over the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident by the suspending work in the camp
that the approaching horseman was someone of importance
in their midst. A Romany rye was he,
dressed in blue corduroy with a scarlet sash at his
waist and a soft scarlet ribbon knotted about his
broad brimmed felt hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>His dark, handsome face, which, when in repose
had an expression of either vanity or cruelty, was
smiling as he dismounted from his spirited black
horse.</p>
<p>Gypsy Nan, who had been standing in the shadow
of a live oak with protecting arms about the goblin-like
Tirol breathed a sigh of relief, for the hated
Spico was evidently in the best of spirits. He called
gayly after the tall gypsy lad who was leading his
horse away: &ldquo;Soobli, where is Mizella, your
queen? Call her forth, I have good news to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was talking the curtains of the largest
van were pushed apart, an old hag-like gypsy appeared,
and, with much groaning, made her way
down the wooden steps to the ground. There she
leaned heavily on a cane, and hobbling toward her
son, asked eagerly: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the pickings like to
be, Spico? Is it a rich gorigo town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich, Mother Mizella?&rdquo; the handsome young
rye repeated. &ldquo;The gorigo around here has his pockets
lined with gold and will spend it freely if he is
amused. You women dress in your gayest and start
out tomorrow with your tambourines. You will
gather in much money with your fortune telling
and we men in the village will not be idle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Then, going to the camp fire, over which a small
pig was being roasted, he asked, looking around
sharply. &ldquo;Where is leicheen Nan? If she has run
away again, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Nan hasn&rsquo;t run away,&rdquo; the gypsy woman,
Manna Lou, hastened to say. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here, Spico.
Come Nan, dearie,&rdquo; she called pleadingly. &ldquo;Come
and speak pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, with a defiant flashing of her dark eyes,
stepped out of the shadow of a low-branching live
oak and stood in the full light of the camp fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leicheen Nan,&rdquo; the Romany rye said, and his
words were a command, &ldquo;tomorrow you will go to
the village and dance at the gorigo inn. You have
idled long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the gypsy woman, Manna Lou, who
replied. &ldquo;Not yet, Spico,&rdquo; she implored in a wheedling
tone&mdash;&ldquo;Nan is only a little gothlin. Wait until
she is grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the angered young rye could answer,
Mizella hobbled to the camp fire and snarled angrily:
&ldquo;I am queen. My word is law. That good-for-nothing
leicheen Nan shall do as my son says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stepped back into the shadow, her heart
rebellious. She said nothing, but she was determined
that she would not obey.</p>
<p>The men then sat about the fire and were served
by the women, who, with the children afterwards ate
what was left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>The moon came up, and Nan, nymph-like, danced
up a grassy hill back of the camp. A throng of
wild, fox-like little children scrambled up after her.
&ldquo;A story. Tell us a story, Nanny,&rdquo; they called. The
girl paused, turned and seeing the crippled Tirol
struggling to climb the hill, she ran back, lifted him
to her strong young shoulder and carried him to the
top of the knoll. There they all sat together, many
bright black eyes watching while Nan told them a
story. A fanciful tale it was of how a gypsy princess
had been cruelly treated by a wicked man like Anselo
Spico. How he had shut the princess and six other
gypsy girls, who had defied him, in a van without
horses and had let it roll down a cliff road into the
sea. &ldquo;But they were not drowned, for the spirits of
the sea-spray carried them up to the sky, and any
clear night you can see that gypsy princess and the
six gypsy girls dancing in their bright crimson and
gold shawls and you call it the sun-set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tirol, always the most intense of Nan&rsquo;s listeners
leaned forward and asked in a low whisper: &ldquo;What
did the sea-spray spirits do to&mdash;to that wicked
Romany rye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night,&rdquo; the gypsy girl said in a low voice
of mystery, &ldquo;he went to the top of a cliff to make
sure the van had gone into the sea, and it had, for it
lay broken in the surf. Then the sea-spray spirits
lifted a wave as high as a hill and it swept over the
cliff and that wicked Romany rye was seen no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Tirol&rsquo;s black eyes glowed in the moonlight and
his frail hand was trembling as Nan took it to lift
him again to her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steal back soft-like, so he won&rsquo;t know we left
camp,&rdquo; she warned. Crouching low, the file of little
fox-like children crept back of trees and brush until
the vans were reached, then darted between the flaps
and crawled, without undressing, into their bunk-like
beds, all but Nan and Tirol. The gypsy girl felt
smothered if she slept in the van.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">THE GARDEN-ALL-AGLOW.</span></h2>
<p>Before day break, Gypsy Nan awakened the goblin-like
boy. Rolled in blankets they had slept in
the shelter of the live oak trees and close to the warm
coals of the camp fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come Tirol,&rdquo; she whispered, glancing at the
wagons, to see if anyone was astir, &ldquo;we must go now,
for Nan isn&rsquo;t going to dance at the inn for the gorigo.
And you must come, too, else that wicked
Anselo Spico will make you stand on a corner and
beg, making money out of your poor little bent body
that&rsquo;s always a-hurting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With many backward glances the two children
stole away to where the mules and ponies were corralled.
After carefully lifting the frail boy to the
back of the mottled horse, Binnie, Nan mounted, and
together they galloped down the coast highway. The
last star had faded, the grey in the East was brightening,
and then suddenly the sun, in a burst of
glory appeared and the sky and sea flamed rose and
amethyst. The dark eyes of the girl glowed with
appreciation and joy, and she started singing a wild,
glad song to a melody of her own creating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>They had gone perhaps a mile from camp and
away from the town when Nan suddenly drew rein
and listened. She heard the beating of hoofs behind
them, but the riders were hidden by the curve in the
road.</p>
<p>Whirling her pony&rsquo;s head she turned down into a
canyon that led to the shore. There she concealed
her horse and with Tirol she lay close to the sand.</p>
<p>Two horsemen passed on the highway, and, as
she had surmised, one was Anselo Spico. She
thought they were hunting for her but she was mistaken.
In the village the Romany rye had heard of
a rich gorigo whose horses were of the finest breed
and whose stables were but slightly guarded, and it
was to inspect this place that they were going.</p>
<p>True, Mizella&rsquo;s son had noticed Nan&rsquo;s absence
that morning but he knew that she would return and
he was planning a cruel punishment which he would
administer for her defiance and disobedience.</p>
<p>Nan remained in hiding until she could no longer
hear the beating of the hoofs, then she said gaily&mdash;&ldquo;Look
Tirol, the sand is hard on the beach. I&rsquo;ll
lift you up again, dearie, and we&rsquo;ll ride along by the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>The boy laughed happily as they rode, so close to
the waves that now and then one broke about the
pony&rsquo;s feet, and the girl laughed, too, for it is easy
to forget troubles when one is young.</p>
<p>They soon came to a beautiful estate where the
park-like grounds reached the edge of the gleaming
white sand, but it was surrounded by a hedge so
high that even on the small horse&rsquo;s back the children
could not see over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tirol,&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, &ldquo;no one could find us
here, and so close up to this high hedge, we&rsquo;ll have
our breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping from the pony the girl, with tender compassion,
carefully lifted down the mis-shapen boy,
then opening a bundle tied in a red handkerchief,
she gave him a thick slice of brown bread and a
piece of roasted pig, which she had stored away the
evening before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; cried the boy, clapping his claw-like
hands. &ldquo;The birds are begging, Nanny, let Tirol
feed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a white cloud shining in the sun the sea
gulls winged down from the sky. Gypsy Nan leaped
to her feet and ran with outstretched arms to greet
them, and the white birds fearlessly circled about her
as she tossed crumbs into the air, and one, braver
than the others lighted on Tirol&rsquo;s outstretched hand
and pecked at his breakfast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>When at last this merry feast was over, the sea
gulls flew away, and Nan called merrily, &ldquo;Tirol,
maybe there&rsquo;s something beautiful behind the hedge
that&rsquo;s so high. Let&rsquo;s go through it, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deformed boy nodded. Many an exciting adventure
he and Nan had when they ran away. But
the gypsy children found that the hedge was as
dense as it was high, and though it was glowing with
small crimson flowers, it was also bristling with
thorns and nowhere was there space enough for
them to break through.</p>
<p>Suddenly Nan, who had danced ahead, gave a
little cry of delight. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the gate, Tirol!&rdquo; she
called. &ldquo;It opens on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly the girl lifted the latch and to her joy
the gate swung open. She leaped within and the boy
followed her. Then for one breathless moment
Gypsy Nan stood with clasped hands and eyes aglow,
as she gazed about her.</p>
<p>Never before had she seen so wonderful a garden.
There were masses of crysanthemums, golden in the
sunlight, and, too, there were banks of flaming
scarlet. In the midst of it all, glistening white in the
sunshine, was a group of marble nymphs, evidently
having a joyous time sporting in the fern-encircled
pool, while a flashing of rainbow colors showered
about them from the fountain. A mockingbird sang
in the pepper tree near the house but there was no
other sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find the gorigo lady that lives here,&rdquo; Nan
whispered. &ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;d let me tell her fortune.
Anselo Spico won&rsquo;t be so angry if we take back a
silver dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up the flowered path, the gypsy children went,
but, though Nan fearlessly lifted the heavy wrought
iron knocker on the door nearest the garden and on
the one at the side, there was no response.</p>
<p>Returning to the garden, the girl stooped and
passionately kissed a glowing yellow crysanthemum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan loves you! Nan loves you bright, beautiful
flower!&rdquo; she said in a low tense voice, &ldquo;Nan
would like to keep you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo; it, why don&rsquo;t you take it?&rdquo; t
Tirol asked. &ldquo;Spico an&rsquo; the rest, they always take
what they want when they can get it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned upon the small boy as she said
almost fiercely. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you time and again
that &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t honest to steal? Don&rsquo;t matter who does
it, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t right, Tirol. Manna Lou said my mother
wouldn&rsquo;t love me if I stole or lied. An&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t
steal! I won&rsquo;t lie! I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many a time Nan had been well beaten because she
would not do these things which so often Anselo
Spico had commanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Then, noting how the small boy shrank away as
if frightened, the girl knelt and held him close in a
passionate embrace. &ldquo;Tirol!&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;Little
Tirol, don&rsquo;t be scared of Nan. &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t you she was
fierce at. &rsquo;Twas him as makes every-body and all the
little ones lie and steal. All the little ones that don&rsquo;t
<i>dare</i> not because he would beat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl felt Tirol&rsquo;s frail body trembling in her
clasp. &ldquo;There, there, dearie. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid.
Anselo Spico don&rsquo;t <i>dare</i> to beat you. He knows if
he did, I&rsquo;d kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was one of the changes of mood that
were so frequently with Nan. Kissing Tirol, she
danced away, flinging her body in wild graceful
movements. Up one path she went, and down
another. Catching up the tambourine which always
hung at her belt, she shook it, singing snatches of
song until she was quite tired out. Then, sinking
down on a marble bench, she held Tirol close and
gazed up at the windows of the house. One after
another she scanned but no face appeared.</p>
<p>Had the proud, haughty owner of that house been
at home, she would have felt that her grounds were
being polluted by the presence of a gypsy.</p>
<p>Suddenly Nan sprang up and held out her hand
for the frail claw-like one of the mis-shapen boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to wait any longer. There&rsquo;s no lady
here to get a dollar from for telling her fortune,&mdash;an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m glad, glad! Fortunes are just lies! I hate
telling fortunes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Down the path they went toward the little gate in
the high hedge which opened out upon the beach.
Turning, before she closed it, the girl waved her
free hand and called joyfully. &ldquo;Good-bye flowers of
gold, Nan&rsquo;s coming back some day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">GOOD-BYE LITTLE TIROL.</span></h2>
<p>The gypsy children returned toward the camp
just as the sun was setting. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you &rsquo;fraid
that Spico&rsquo;ll strike us?&rdquo; the goblin-like boy asked,
holding close to Nan as the small, mottled pony galloped
along the coast road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m not scared,&rdquo; Nan said. &ldquo;If he strikes
us, we&rsquo;ll run away for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we go back and live in that garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;d go. Somewheres! Maybe
up there.&rdquo; Nan pointed and the boy glanced at the
encircling mountains where the canyons were darkening.
Surely they would be well hidden there.
They were close enough now to see the smoke curling
up from the camp fire near the clump of live oaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Leaving the small horse in the rope corral with
the others, the children approached the wagons, keeping
hidden behind bushes as best they could. Nan
wanted to see who was about the fire before she
made her presence known. The one whom she
dreaded was not there and so she boldly walked into
the circle of the light, leading Tirol. Then she
spoke the gypsies&rsquo; word of greeting: &ldquo;Sarishan,
Manna Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leicheen Nan, dearie, how troubled my heart has
been about you,&rdquo; the gypsy woman said. &ldquo;You ran
away. I thought forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Anselo Spico?&rdquo; the girl inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t come yet. Mizella&rsquo;s been asking this
hour back. He said at high sun he&rsquo;d be here sure,
more than likely he&rsquo;s been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; Nan whispered, putting a protecting arm
about the boy. &ldquo;Hide, quick, Tirol, here he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But only one horseman appeared, galloping
through the dusk, and that one was Vestor, who had
ridden away with the Romany rye that morning. His
dark face told them nothing and yet they knew that
he had much to tell. They gathered about him, but
before he could speak, the old queen pushed her way
to the front. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my son?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In jail for tryin&rsquo; to steal a rich gorigo&rsquo;s horse.&rdquo;
Then Vestor added mysteriously. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll join us
afore dawn, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you! Break camp at once,&rdquo;
he commanded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re to wait for Spico in a mountain
canyon on t&rsquo;other side of town. I know where
&rsquo;tis. I&rsquo;ll ride the leader.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>The supper was hastily eaten, the fire beaten out,
the mules and horses watered and hitched. Just as
the moon rose over the sea, the gypsy caravan began
moving slowly down the coast highway.</p>
<p>Nan, riding on her mottled pony, sincerely wished
that Anselo Spico would not escape, but he always
did, as she knew only too well.</p>
<p>Two hours later the caravan stopped on a lonely
mountain road and drew to one side. Half an hour
later everyone was asleep, but in the middle of the
night Nan was awakened by a familiar voice.</p>
<p>Anselo Spico had returned.</p>
<p>Long before daybreak the gypsy caravan was once
more under way. The jolting of the wagon of
Manna Lou roused the girl. She climbed from her
berth and looked in the one lower to see if all was
well with little Tirol. Two big black eyes gazed out
at her and one of the claw-like hands reached toward
her. Nan took it lovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Tirol,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t feeling well.&rdquo;
The goblin-like boy shook his head as he replied: &ldquo;A
crooked back hurts, Sister Nan. It hurts all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know dearie!&rdquo; the girl said tenderly
gathering the little fellow close in her arms. &ldquo;Wait,
Nan will bring you some breakfast.&rdquo; But the boy
turned away and wearily closed his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>The caravan had stopped long enough to make a
fire and prepare the morning coffee. Soon Manna
Lou entered the wagon. &ldquo;Go out, Nan darling,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear Spico. He only thinks of getting
across the border in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl beckoned to the gypsy woman and said
in a low voice, &ldquo;Little Tirol&rsquo;s not so well. We&rsquo;d
ought to stop at the next town and fetch a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little Tirol,&rdquo; the gypsy woman said kindly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be lonely, Nan, to have him go, but if the
gorigo is right, if there is a heaven, then little Tirol&rsquo;ll
be happier, for there&rsquo;s been no harm in him here.
And there can&rsquo;t be anyone so cruel as Anselo Spico&rsquo;s
been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan clenched her hands and frowned. Manna
Lou continued. &ldquo;Perhaps his own mother Zitha will
be there waiting, and she&rsquo;ll take care of him. Before
she died, she gave me little Tirol and begged me
to keep watch over him and I&rsquo;ve done my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively Nan put her arms about the gypsy
woman as she said, &ldquo;Manna Lou, how good, how
kind you are! You&rsquo;ve been just like a mother to
little Tirol and me, too. Some day you&rsquo;re going to
tell me who my own mother was, aren&rsquo;t you, Manna
Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, leicheen Nan. When you&rsquo;re eighteen, then
I&rsquo;m going to tell you. I promised faithful I wouldn&rsquo;t
tell before that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>As the morning wore on, it was plain to the
watchers that little Tirol was very ill and when at
noon the caravan stopped, Nan, leaping from the
wagon of Manna Lou confronted Anselo Spico as
she said courageously: &ldquo;Little Tirol is like to die.
We&rsquo;ve got to stop at that town down there into the
valley and fetch a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to?&rdquo; sneered the dark handsome man, then
he smiled wickedly. &ldquo;Since when is leicheen Nan
the queen of this tribe that she gives commands?
What we&rsquo;ve got to do is cross over the border into
Mexico before the gorigo police gets track of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away and Nan with indignation and
pity in her heart, went back to the wagon. As she
sat by the berth, holding Tirol&rsquo;s hot hand, she determined
that as soon as the village was reached
she herself would ride ahead and find a doctor.</p>
<p>Manna Lou had tried all of the herbs, but nothing
of which the gypsies knew could help the goblin-like
boy or quiet his cruel pain.</p>
<p>It was mid-afternoon when Nan saw that the
winding downward road was leading into a valley
town. It would take the slow moving caravan at
least an hour to reach the village, while Nan, on her
pony, could gallop there very quickly. Not far below
was a dense grouping of live oak trees. She would
slip among them on Binnie and then, out of sight of
the caravan, she would gallop across the fields to the
town. &ldquo;Manna Lou,&rdquo; the girl said softly that she
need not awaken the sleeping Tirol, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for a
little ride.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice, dearie,&rdquo; the kind gypsy woman replied.
&ldquo;It will do you good. The sunshine is warm
and cheery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a rough road and the caravan was moving
slowly. Many of the fox-like gypsy children were
running alongside, and Nan joined them.</p>
<p>She wanted to be sure where Anselo Spico was
riding. As she had hoped, he was on the driver&rsquo;s
seat of Queen Mizella&rsquo;s wagon which was always in
the lead.</p>
<p>Running back, she was about to mount her pony
when she heard her name called softly. Turning,
she saw Manna Lou beckoning to her. Springing
to the home wagon, she went inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Manna Lou?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You look
so strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought little Tirol was asleep all this time,
and so he <i>was</i>, but it&rsquo;s the kind of sleep that you
don&rsquo;t waken from. Maybe he&rsquo;s in the gorigo heaven
now with Zitha, his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl felt awed. &ldquo;Why, Manna Lou,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;little Tirol looks happier than I ever
saw him before. See how sweetly he&rsquo;s smiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearie, he is happier, for his poor, crooked
back was always hurting him, but he was a brave
little fellow, cheerful and uncomplaining.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>The caravan stopped and Manna Lou went out to
tell the others what had happened. The gypsy girl,
alone with the boy who had so loved her, knelt by
his side and kissing him tenderly, she said: &ldquo;Little
Tirol, darling, Nan has staid here and put up with
the cruelty of Angelo Spico, just to be taking care
of you, but now that you aren&rsquo;t needing Nan any
more, she&rsquo;s going far away. Good-bye, dearie.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>That night while the caravan was moving at a
slow pace over the moonlit road and all save the
drivers were asleep, Nan, slipped out of Manna
Lou&rsquo;s wagon, leaped to the back of Binnie and galloped
back by the way they had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">NAN ESCAPES.</span></h2>
<p>All night long Gypsy Nan, on the back of her
small horse Binnie climbed the steep mountain road,
a full moon far over her head transforming everything about
her to shimmering silver.</p>
<p>A bundle tied in a beautiful shawl of scarlet and
gold contained all that belonged to her and food
enough to last for several days.</p>
<p>Nan was on the ridge of a mountain road when the
sun rose, and to her joy saw the village of San
Seritos lying in the valley below, and beyond was
the gleaming blue sea.</p>
<p>She drew rein and gazed ahead wondering where
she should go, when her ears, trained to notice all
of nature&rsquo;s sounds, heard the startled cry of some
little ground animal. Dismounting, she bent over
the place from which the sound had come and saw
an evil-eyed rattle-snake about to spring upon a
squirrel that seemed powerless to get away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Nan, whose heart was always filled with pity for
creatures that were weak and helpless, threw a rock
at the snake which glided into the underbrush. Then
she lifted the squirrel, feeling its heart pounding
against her hand. She carried the little thing across
the road and placed it on an overhanging limb of a
live oak tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now! Nan&rsquo;s given you a chance to get
away from the snake. That&rsquo;s what Anselo Spico is,
a rattle-snake, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m trying to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to mount on her pony when she
again paused and listened intently. This time she
heard the galloping of a horse. Peering through
the trees, back of her, she saw a black pony and its
rider fairly plunging down the rough road on the
opposite side of the canyon she had just crossed. In
half an hour, perhaps less, that horse and rider would
reach the spot where she was standing.</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s fears were realized. She was being pursued.
The rider she knew even at that distance, to
be Vestor, a cruel man who would do anything his
master Anselo Spico commanded.</p>
<p>Where could she hide? It would have been easier
if she had been alone, but it would not be a simple
matter to conceal the pony. Mounting, the girl raced
ahead. A turn in the mountain road brought her to
a ranch. It was so very early that no one was astir.
Riding in and trusting to fate to protect her, she
went at once to a great barn and seeing a stack of
hay in one corner, she wedged her pony back of it
and stood, scarcely breathing, waiting for, she knew
not what, to happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>But, although the moments dragged into an hour,
no one came. At last, unable to endure the suspense
longer, the girl slipped from her hiding-place,
and, keeping close to the wall of the old barn she
sidled slowly toward a wide door. She heard voices
not far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t seen nothing of a black-haired wench
in a yellar an&rsquo; red dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Vestor speaking and it was quite evident
that he was snarling angry. Nan peered through a
knot-hole, her heart beating tempestuously. The
gypsy&rsquo;s gimlet-like black eyes were keeping a sharp
lookout all about him as he talked. The rancher&rsquo;s
back was toward the girl. He, at first, quietly replied,
but when Vestor took a step toward the barn,
saying he&rsquo;d take a look around himself, the brawny
rancher caught his arm, whirled him about and
pointed toward the road. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have none of <i>your</i>
kind prowlin&rsquo; about <i>my</i> place. You&rsquo;d lake a look,
all right, but I reckon you&rsquo;d take everything else that
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t held down wi&rsquo; a ton of rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know the thievin&rsquo;, lying lot of you. I&rsquo;d as soon
shoot one of you down as I would a skunk, an&rsquo; sooner,
if &rsquo;twant for the law upholding of you, though
gosh knows why it does.&rdquo; Then, as Vestor kept
looking intently at the open barn door, the rancher,
infuriated by the man&rsquo;s doggedly remaining when he
had been told to be off, sprang toward a wagon,
snatched a whip and began to lash the gypsy about
the legs.</p>
<p>With cries of pain, Vestor turned an ugly visage
toward the rancher, but meeting only determination
and equal hatred, he thought better of his attempt to
spring at him, turned, went to his black pony, mounted
it and rode rapidly back the way he had come.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to be too far behind the caravan
fearing that the gorigo police might take <i>him</i> up and
put him in jail on Anselo&rsquo;s offense.</p>
<p>The rancher stood perfectly still for sometime
after the gypsy had ridden away, then he also turned
and looked toward the barn. Nan had at once
sidled to her place back of the hay stack and so
she did not see that he slowly walked that way.</p>
<p>Stopping in the door he listened intently. Then
shrugging his shoulders, he went into the house to
his breakfast. Half an hour later he again sauntered
to the barn door. &ldquo;Gal,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Hi, there, you
gypsy gal! That black soul&rsquo;d critter&rsquo;s gone this long
while. Don&rsquo;t be afeard to come out. Ma&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo;
to give you some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Surely Nan could trust a voice so kindly. Timidly
she appeared, leading the pony who was munching
a mouthful of hay. The rancher smiled at the girl
in a way to set her fears at rest, at least as far as
he was concerned, but once out in the open she
glanced around wildly.&mdash;&ldquo;Where is he? Where&rsquo;s
that Vestor gone? Will he be back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, the rancher motioned the girl to
follow him. He led her to a high peak back of the
barn. &ldquo;You kin see from here to all sides,&rdquo; he said:
&ldquo;You lie low, sort of, behind that big rock an&rsquo; keep
watchin&rsquo;. The scoundrel rode off that a-way. If
he keep&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll see him soon. If he turned
back, well, I&rsquo;ll let out the dogs.&rdquo; Nan did as she
had been told and from that high position, she soon
saw, far across the canyon, riding rapidly to the
south, the black pony bearing the man she feared.</p>
<p>She rose greatly relieved. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone sure enough,
Vestor has.&rdquo; Then, suspiciously she turned toward
the man. &ldquo;How did you know where I was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you go in,&rdquo; the rancher told her, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I was
settin&rsquo; outside waitin for you to come out with
whatever &rsquo;twas, you&rsquo;d gone in to steal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dark red mantled the girl&rsquo;s face, and she said
in a low voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t steal an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t lie, but he
does.&rdquo; She jerked her head in the direction Vestor
had taken. &ldquo;So do the rest, mostly, but, they don&rsquo;t
all. Manna Lou don&rsquo;t steal and she don&rsquo;t lie. She
fetched me up not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s dark eyes looked into the penetrating
grey eyes of the rancher with such a direct gaze that
he believed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>A woman appeared on the back porch and called
to them. &ldquo;Fetch the gal in for a bite of breakfast if
she ain&rsquo;t too wild like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t want any breakfast,&rdquo; Nan
said. Then, noting that Binnie was still chewing on
the hay he had pulled from the stack, she added,&mdash;&ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t any money, or I&rsquo;d pay for what he&rsquo;s
had. I couldn&rsquo;t keep him from eating it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you couldn&rsquo;t, gal,&rdquo; the rancher said
kindly. Then, as he saw that the girl was determined
to mount her pony and ride away, he asked&mdash;&ldquo;Where
are you going to? I don&rsquo;t have to ask
<i>what</i> you&rsquo;re running away from? I <i>know</i> that
purty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head and without a smile, she
again said &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Then, quite unexpectedly,
for the man had seen her make no sign, the pony
broke into a run and she was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">NAN REVISITS THE GARDEN.</span></h2>
<p>For half an hour Nan rode, bent low in her saddle
possibly with the thought that she would be less
noticeable. Each time that the winding road brought
her to an open place where she could see across the
valley, she drew rein and gazed steadily at the ribbon-like
trail which appeared, was lost to sight, and
re-appeared for many miles to the south.</p>
<p>At last what she sought was seen, a horseman
so small because of the distance that he appeared no
larger than a toy going rapidly away. Sitting
erect, the girl gazed down in the other direction and
saw the garden city of San Seritos between the
mountains and the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, Binnie!&rdquo; she cried, her black eyes glowing.
&ldquo;I know where we&rsquo;ll go.&mdash;Back to that beach place
where the flowers of gold are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>And then, in the glory of the still early morning,
with her black hair flying back of her, the girl in
the red and yellow dress galloped down to the highway
and rode around the village, that no-one might
see her and arrest her because she was a gypsy.</p>
<p>There were but few astir at so early an hour, but
the sun was high in the heavens when at last she
reached the little ravine that led down to the sea.</p>
<p>This time she breakfasted alone in the shadow of
the high hedge, and the shining white birds did not
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they only came for little Tirol,&rdquo; she
thought. Then springing up, she stretched her arms
toward the gleaming blue sky as she said: &ldquo;I do
want little Tirol to be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was an impulse and not a prayer, for the
gypsies had no religion, and Nan knew nothing
really of the heaven of the gorigo.</p>
<p>Then, telling Binnie to wait for her she opened the
gate and entered the garden. The masses of golden
and scarlet bloom, the glistening of many colors in
the fountain, the joyous song of birds in the red-berried
pepper trees fascinated the gypsy girl, and
she danced about like some wild thing, up and down
the garden paths, pausing now and then to press her
cheek passionately against a big yellow crysanthemum
that stood nearly as tall as she, and to it she
would murmur lovingly in strange Romany words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>She was following a path which she and Tirol had
not found, suddenly she paused and listened. She
had heard voices, and peering through the low hanging
branches of an ornamental tree, she saw a pretty
cottage by the side of great iron gates that stood
ajar. Here lived the head gardener and his little
family. A buxum, kindly faced young woman was
talking to a small girl of seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Bertha, watch Bobbie careful,&rdquo; she was
saying. &ldquo;Mammy is going up to the big house. The
grand ladies is comin&rsquo; home today an&rsquo; every-thin&rsquo;
must be spic and ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan darted deeper among the shrubs and bushes
for the young woman passed so close that she
could have touched her. The gypsy girl remained
in hiding and watched the small children who looked
strange to her with their flaxen hair and pink cheeks
used as she was to the dark-eyed, black-haired, fox-like
little gypsies.</p>
<p>The baby boy was a chubby laughing two-year-old,
&ldquo;Birdie,&rdquo; as he called his sister, played with him
for a time on the grass in front of their cottage. At
last, wearying of this, she said&mdash;&ldquo;Now Bobby, you
sit right still like a mouse while Birdie goes and fetches
out her dollie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Springing up, the little girl ran indoors. A second
later a butterfly darted past the wee boy. Gurgling
in delight, he scrambled to his feet and toddled uncertainly
after it. Out through the partly-open
iron gates he went, and then, tripping, he sprawled
in the dust of the roadway. At that same instant
Nan heard the chugging of an oncoming machine
and leaping from her hiding place, she darted through
the gates and into the road. A big touring car was
swerving around a corner. The frightened baby,
after trying to scramble to his feet, had fallen again.</p>
<p>Nan, seizing him, hurled him to the soft grass by
the roadside. Then she fell and the machine passed
over her. The &ldquo;grand ladies&rdquo; had returned.</p>
<p>The car stopped almost instantly, and the chauffeur
lifted the limp form of the gypsy girl in his
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s dead, Miss Barrington,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and if you ladies wish I&rsquo;ll take her right to
the county hospital as quickly as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older woman spoke coldly. &ldquo;No, I would
not consider that I was doing my duty if I sent her
to the county hospital. You may carry her into the
house, Martin, and then procure a physician at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Barrington, she&rsquo;s nothing but a gypsy,
and yours the proudest family in all San Seritos or
anywhere for that,&rdquo; the man said, with the freedom
of an old servant.</p>
<p>Then, it was that the other lady spoke, and in her
voice was the warmth of pity and compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll take the poor child into our
home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She may be only a gypsy girl,
but no greater thing can anyone do than risk his
own life for another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>And so the seemingly lifeless Gypsy Nan was carried
into the mansion-like home which stood in the
garden-all-aglow that she had so loved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">ONLY A GYPSY-GIRL.</span></h2>
<p>When at last the girl opened her eyes, she looked
about her in half dazed wonder. Where could she
be? In a room so beautiful that she thought perhaps
it was the gorigo heaven. The walls were the blue of
the sky, and the draperies were the gold of the sun,
while the wide windows framed glowing pictures of
the sea and the garden.</p>
<p>For the first time in her roaming life, Nan was in
a luxurious bed. Hearing the faint rustle of leaves
at her side, she turned her head and saw a grey-haired,
kindly faced woman, who was gowned in a
soft silvery cashmere; a bow of pink fastened the
creamy lace mantle about her shoulders. It was
Miss Dahlia Barrington, who was reading a large
book. Hearing a movement from the bed, she looked
up with a loving smile, and closing the book, she
placed it on a table and bent over the wondering
eyed girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I, lady?&rdquo; Nan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in the Barrington Manor, dear. My
sister&rsquo;s home and mine. Do you not recall what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lady, was the little boy hurt, lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not, thanks to you,&rdquo; Miss Dahlia said.
&ldquo;Tell me your name, dear, that I may know what to
call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s dark eyes grew wistful and she looked
for a moment out toward the sea. Then she said
in a very low voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know my name, only
just Nan.&rdquo; It was then she remembered that her
race was scorned by the white gorigo, and, trying
to rise, she added, &ldquo;I must go now, lady. I must go
back to Manna Lou. I&rsquo;m only a gypsy. You won&rsquo;t
want me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a gypsy?&rdquo; the little woman said gently, as
she covered the brown hand lovingly with her own
frail white one. &ldquo;Dearie, you are just as much a
child of God as I am or Miss Barrington is, or indeed,
any-one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Nan could not understand the words, for they
were strange to her, but she could understand the
loving caress, and, being weary, she again closed
her eyes, but a few moments later she was aroused
by a cold, unloving voice that was saying: &ldquo;Yes,
doctor, I understand that she is a gypsy, and that
probably she will steal everything that she can lay
her hands on, but I will have things locked up when
she is strong enough to be about. I consider that
she was sent here by Providence, and that it is therefore
my duty to keep the little heathen and try to
civilize and Christianize her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the older Miss Barrington who was speaking.
Nan, who had never stolen even a flower, was
keenly hurt, and she determined to run away as soon
as ever she could.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The chimes of the great clock in the lower hall
were musically telling the midnight hour when the
girl, seemingly strengthened by her determined resolve,
sat up in bed and listened intently.</p>
<p>She had heard a noise beyond the garden hedge,
and her heart leaped joyously. It was Binnie, her
mottled pony, calling to her. All day long he had
been waiting for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, Binnie darling,&rdquo; the gypsy girl
whispered. Then, climbing from the bed, she dressed
quickly, and, fearing that if she opened the door
she might be heard, she climbed through the window
and on a vine covered trellis descended to the garden.</p>
<p>How beautiful it was in the moonlight, she
thought, but she dared not pause. Down the path
she sped and out at the gate in the hedge.</p>
<p>Binnie, overjoyed at seeing his mistress, whinnied
again.</p>
<p>Gypsy Nan gave the small horse an impulsive hug
as she whispered: &ldquo;Binnie dearie, be quiet or some
one will hear you. We must go away now, far, far
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pony, seemingly to understand, trotted along
on the hard sand with the gypsy girl clinging to his
back, for the strength, which had seemed to come to
her when she determined to run away, was gone and
she felt weak and dazed. A few moments later she
slipped from the pony&rsquo;s back and lay unconscious on
the sand while the faithful Binnie stood guard over
her.</p>
<p>It was not until the next afternoon that she again
opened her eyes and found herself once more in the
beautiful blue and gold room and at her bedside sat
the gentle Miss Dahlia gazing at her with an expression
of mingled sorrow and loving tenderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Little Nan,&rdquo; she said, when she saw that the girl
had awakened, &ldquo;Why did you run away from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from you, lady, from the other one, who
called me thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia glanced quickly toward the door as
she said softly, &ldquo;Dearie, my sister, Miss Barrington,
has had many disappointments, and she seems to
have lost faith in the world, but I am sure that she
means to be kind.&rdquo; Then the little lady added with a
sigh, &ldquo;I had so hoped you would want to stay with
me, for I am very lonely now that Cherise is gone.
She was nearly your age and this was her room,
Shall I tell you about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia clasped the brown hand lovingly as
she began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago I had a twin brother, whom I dearly
loved, but he married a very beautiful girl, who sang
at concerts, and my sister, Miss Barrington, who
sometimes seems unjust, would not receive her into
our home, and my brother, who was deeply hurt,
never communicated with us again. Many years
passed and then one day a little girl of ten came to
our door with a letter. She said that her name was
Cherise and that her father and mother were dead.
It was my dear brother&rsquo;s child. My sister, Miss
Barrington was in the city where she spends many
of the autumn months, and so I kept the little thing
and told no one about her. Those were indeed happy
days for me. This room, which had dark furniture
and draperies, I had decorated in blue and gold just
for her, and how she loved it. With her golden
curls and sweet blue eyes she looked like a fairy in
her very own bower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Nan, you can&rsquo;t know what a joy Cherise
was to me. We spent long hours together in the
garden with our books, for I would allow no one
else to teach her, but, when she was fourteen, her
spirits slipped away and left me alone. I thought
when you came that perhaps Cherise had led you here
that I might have someone to love. I do wish you
would stay, at least for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan looked into the wistful, loving face and then
she turned to gaze out of the window. She was
silent for so long that Miss Dahlia was sure that she
would say no, but when the gypsy girl spoke, she
said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay until the gold flowers fade out there
in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, dearie,&rdquo; and then impulsively the
little lady added: &ldquo;Try to love me, Nan, and I am
sure that we will be happy together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The days that followed were hard ones for the
gypsy girl, who felt as a wild bird must when it
is first imprisoned in a cage, and her heart was
often rebellious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll keep my word,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay
till the gold flowers fade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder Miss Barrington began at once to try
to civilize Nan, and the result was not very satisfactory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">CIVILIZING GYPSY NAN.</span></h2>
<p>The first day that Nan was strong enough to
sit up Miss Barrington entered the room, followed
by a maid, who was carrying a large box. The
gypsy girl was seated by one of the windows,
wrapped in a woolly blue robe that belonged to Miss
Dahlia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne!&rdquo; the cold voice was saying, &ldquo;that is the
name I have decided to call you. Nan is altogether
too frivolous for a Christian girl, and that is what
I expect you to become. In order that you may
cease to look like a heathen as soon as possible, I
have had your gypsy toggery stored in the attic
and I have purchased for you dresses that are quiet
and ladylike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning to the maid, she said: &ldquo;Marie, you
may open the box and spread the contents on the
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>There were two dresses. One was a dark brown
wool, made in the plainest fashion, and the other
was a dull blue.</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s eyes flashed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wear those ugly
things!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You have no right to take my
own beautiful dress from me.&rdquo; Miss Barrington
drew her self up haughtily as she replied coldly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will wear the dresses that I provide, or
you will remain in your room. It is my duty, I assure
you, not my pleasure, to try to change your
heathen ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying Miss Barrington departed.</p>
<p>As soon as they were alone Miss Dahlia went
over to the side of Nan&rsquo;s chair, and smoothing the
dark hair with a loving hand, she said, pleadingly:
&ldquo;Dearie, wear them just for a time. My sister
will soon be going to the city and you shall have
something pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, since the girl&rsquo;s eyes were still rebellious,
the little lady opened a drawer and taking out a
box she gave it to Nan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those ribbons and trinklets belonged to Cherise.
She would be glad to have you wear them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>The box contained many hair ribbons, some of
soft hues and others of warm, glowing colors. Too,
there was a slender gold chain with a lovely locket
of pearls forming a flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how pretty, pretty!&rdquo; the gypsy girl murmured,
and then instinctively wanting to say thank
you, and not knowing how, she kissed the wrinkled
cheek of the dear old lady.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of happy times for these
two. When Nan was able to be out in the garden,
she had her first reading lesson, and how pleased she
was when at last she could read a simple fairy tale
quite by herself from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p>The elder Miss Barrington, who was interested
in culture clubs, was luckily away much of the time,
but one day something happened which made that
proud lady deeply regret that she had tried to civilize
a heathen gypsy.</p>
<p>It was Sunday and the two ladies were ready to
start for church. Nan was to have accompanied
them. A neat tailored suit had been provided for
her Sunday wear, a pair of kid gloves and a blue
sailor hat. That morning when the gypsy girl
went up to her room, she found a maid there who
informed her that she was to dress at once as the
ladies would start for St. Martin&rsquo;s-by-the-sea in
half an hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>When she was alone, Nan put on the garment
that was so strange to her and the queer stiff hat.
She stood looking in the long mirror and her eyes
flashed. She would not wear that ugly head dress.
She was not a gorigo and she would not dress like
one. She heard someone ascending the stairs, and,
believing it to be Miss Barrington coming to command
that she go to church with them, Nan darted
out into the corridor and opening the first door that
she came to, she entered a dark hall where she had
never been before. A flight of wooden stairs was
there and ever so quietly she stole up, and, opening
another door at the top, she entered the attic. Then
she stood still and listened. She heard faint voices
far below. Evidently Miss Barrington was looking
for her. Nan glanced about to see where she would
hide if anyone came up the stairs but no one did,
and soon she heard an automobile going down the
drive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Darting to a small window, to her relief, she saw
that both ladies were on their way to church. Then
suddenly she remembered something! She had given
her word to dear Miss Dahlia that she would attend
the morning service and she had never before
broken a promise, but she could not, she would not
wear that ugly suit and that stiff round hat. As
she turned from the window, a flash of color caught
her eye. There was an old trunk near and a bit
of scarlet protruded from beneath the cover. With
a cry of joy, Nan leaped to the spot and lifted the
lid. Just as she had hoped, it was her own beautiful
dress.</p>
<p>Gathering it lovingly in her arms, she started down
the attic stairs, tiptoeing quietly lest she attract the
attention of a maid.</p>
<p>Once in her room, she locked the door and joyously
dressed in the old way, a yellow silk handkerchief
wound about her flowing dark hair, and the
gorgeous crimson and gold shawl draped about her
shoulders.</p>
<p>No one saw the gypsy girl as she stole from the
back door and into the garden-all-aglow. She
picked a big, curly-yellow crysanthemum (for Miss
Dahlia had told her to gather them whenever she
wished) and she fastened it in the shawl. Then
mounting her pony, she galloped down the highway.
She was going to attend the morning services at
the little stone church, St. Martin&rsquo;s-by-the-sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>At the solemn moment when all heads were
bowed in prayer, Nan reached the picturesque, ivy
covered stone church and stood gazing wonderingly
in at the open door.</p>
<p>Never before had this child of nature been in
the portal of a church, and she felt strangely awed
by the silence and wondered why the people knelt and
were so still. Nan had never heard of prayer to
an unseen God.</p>
<p>Her first impulse was to steal out again and gallop
away up the mountain road where birds were
singing, the sun glowing on red pepper berries, and
everything was joyous. The gypsy girl could understand
Nature&rsquo;s way of giving praise to its creator,
but she had promised Miss Dahlia that she
would attend the morning service, and so she would
stay. Gazing over the bowed heads with joy she
recognized one of them. Her beloved Miss Dahlia
and the dreaded Miss Ursula occupied the Barrington
pew, which was near the chancel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Tiptoeing down the aisle, she reached the pew
just as the congregation rose to respond to a chanted
prayer. Unfortunately Miss Ursula sat on the
outside, and there was not room for Nan. She
stood still and gazed about helplessly. A small boy
in front of Miss Barrington had turned, and seeing
Nan, he tugged on his mother&rsquo;s sleeve and whispered:
&ldquo;Look, Mummie, here&rsquo;s a real gypsy in our
church.&rdquo; Miss Ursula turned also, and when she
beheld Nan in that &ldquo;heathen costume,&rdquo; her face
became a deep scarlet, and the expression in her
eyes was not one that should have been inspired by
her recent devotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home at once.&rdquo; she said, in a low voice,
&ldquo;and remain in your room until I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan left the church. She was glad, glad to be
once more out in the sunshine. She did not want
to know the God of the gorigo if He dwelt in that
dreary, sunless place.</p>
<p>As she galloped down the coast highway, how she
wished that she might ride up into the mountains
and never return.</p>
<p>Then she thought of Miss Dahlia. Just for a
fleeting moment she had caught that dear little
lady&rsquo;s glance when Miss Barrington was dismissing
her, and Nan was almost sure that Miss Dahlia&rsquo;s
sweet grey eyes had twinkled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will only have to stay until the gold blossoms
fade,&rdquo; the girl thought a little later, as she wandered
about the garden paths peering into the curly yellow
crysanthemums, wondering how much longer they
would last. With a sigh, Nan went indoors and up
to her room.</p>
<p>Undressing, she placed the gown that she so
loved in a bureau drawer, and then, to please Miss
Dahlia she put on the simple blue cashmere and
sat with folded hands waiting to hear in what manner
she was to be punished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">NAN&rsquo;S PUNISHMENT.</span></h2>
<p>Half an hour later Nan heard the automobile
returning and she sighed resignedly. The gypsy
girl&rsquo;s heart was rebellious, yet she would bear with
it a little longer for Miss Dahlia&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>The door was opening, but Nan, with folded
hands still gazed out of the window. A severe
voice spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne, when I enter the room, I wish you to
rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lady,&rdquo; was the listless reply as the girl
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one thing more. I do not wish you to call
me &lsquo;lady&rsquo; in that gypsy fashion. If you wish to say
Lady Ursula, you may do so. My English ancestry
entitles me to that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Barrington and Miss Dahlia then seated
themselves, but Nan remained standing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; the former asked
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; a gentle voice interceded, &ldquo;Nan can&rsquo;t
know our parlor manners, when she has been
brought up in the big out-of-doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will soon have the opportunity to learn
them, however,&rdquo; Miss Barrington said coldly, &ldquo;for I
have decided, since this morning&rsquo;s performance, to
place Anne in a convent school. I find the task of
Christianizing and civilizing a heathen more than I
care to undertake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sister Ursula, don&rsquo;t send Nan away,&rdquo; the
other little lady implored. &ldquo;Let me teach her. I
will do so gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; The tone was scornful. &ldquo;Do you suppose
that you can succeed where I fail? No indeed,
Anne shall tomorrow depart for a convent school
which is connected with our church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then rising, she added: &ldquo;We will now descend
to the dining room and we will consider the subject
closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the proud Miss Barrington glanced at the
girl who was keeping so still, she might have seen
a gleam in the dark eyes which showed that her
spirit was not yet broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>As they went down the wide stairway, Miss Dahlia
slipped her hand over the brown one that hung
listlessly at the girl&rsquo;s side. Nan understood that it
was an assurance of the little lady&rsquo;s love, and her
heart responded with sudden warmth.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>All that afternoon Nan sat in a sheltered corner
of the garden with a beautiful story that she was
trying to read, but her thoughts were continually
planning and plotting. She could not and would not
be sent to a convent school. She was only staying
to keep her promise to Miss Dahlia, but now that
Miss Ursula was sending her away, she was freed
from that promise.</p>
<p>Just then a maid appeared, saying: &ldquo;Miss Barrington
wishes to see you in the library at once.
She&rsquo;s got a telegram from somewhere and she&rsquo;s all
upset about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Nan entered the stately library, she saw
Miss Barrington standing near Miss Dahlia&rsquo;s chair,
and the younger woman was saying: &ldquo;But, Sister
Ursula, it would be of no use for me to go. I know
nothing of law and of things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite aware of the fact,&rdquo; the older woman
said, &ldquo;and I had no intention whatever of requesting
you to go, but it is most inconvenient for me to spend
several months in the East just at this time. I am
president of the Society for Civic Improvements,
and an active and influential member in many other
clubs, as you know.&rdquo; Then, noting that Nan had
entered the room, she turned toward her as she
said coldly: &ldquo;Anne, I shall be obliged to leave for
New York on the early morning train. A wealthy
aunt has passed away, leaving a large fortune to my
sister and myself, but unfortunately, the will is to
be contested, which necessitates the presence of an
heir who has some knowledge of legal matters. I
may be away for several months, and so I will have
to leave you in my sister&rsquo;s care, trusting that she
will see the advisability of sending you to a convent
school as soon as a suitable wardrobe can be
prepared. That is all! You may now retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been hard for Nan to quietly listen to this
glorious and astounding news. She did glance for
one second at Miss Dahlia, and she was sure that she
saw a happy light in those sweet grey eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>The next morning the household was astir at a
very early hour, and at nine o&rsquo;clock the automobile
returned from the station and Miss Dahlia was
in it alone.</p>
<p>Nan joyously ran across the lawn and caught
the outstretched hands of the little lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dahlia,&rdquo; the girl implored, &ldquo;you
aren&rsquo;t going to send me to a convent, are you? Because,
if you do, I am going to run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, dearie,&rdquo; Miss Dahlia replied, as she
sat on a marble bench near the fountain, and drew
the girl down beside her.</p>
<p>Then she laughed as Nan had never heard her
laugh before. There was real joy in it. &ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I begged my sister to permit me to do
what I could to try to civilize you while she is away,
and, because her mind was so much occupied with
other and weightier matters, she gave her consent,
but she made me promise that you would attend
service with me wearing proper clothes, and that I
would teach you to sew and also lady-like manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dahlia, I, will civilize fast enough for
you, because I love you,&rdquo; the girl said, impulsively,
as she pressed a wrinkled hand to her flush brown
cheek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I love you, Nan, you don&rsquo;t know how
dearly, and you needn&rsquo;t civilize too much, if you
don&rsquo;t want to. I love you just as you are. I am
going to engage masters to come and teach you
piano, singing and the harp or violin as you prefer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s dark eyes glowed happily as she exclaimed,
&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dahlia, how I love music; everything,
every-where that sings; the brook, the bird,
the wind in the trees! How glad I will be to learn
to make music as they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two wonderful weeks passed. A little French
lady came to teach Nan languages, for which she
had a remarkable aptitude, and when she began to
sing as sweetly and naturally as the wood birds,
Miss Dahlia was indeed delighted, and in the long
evenings she taught the gypsy girl the songs that she
used to sing. Too, there had been a shopping expedition
to the village, and Nan had chosen a soft
cashmere dress, the color of ripe cherries with the
sun shining on them. At the beginning of the
third week something happened which was destined
to do much toward civilizing Nan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE LAD NEXT DOOR.</span></h2>
<p>It was Saturday and lessons were over for the
week. Of tutors and music masters there would be
none all that glorious day. Miss Dahlia had awakened
with a headache. Nan slipped into the darkened room
and asked tenderly if there was something
that she could do to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dearie,&rdquo; the little lady replied, &ldquo;I will just
rest awhile. Go for a ride on Binnie if you wish.
I will try to be down so that you need not have
luncheon alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later the girl emerged from a
vine-hung side entrance and stood looking about.
She wore her cherry red dress and the yellow silk
handkerchief, with its dangles, was about her head.</p>
<p>In her hand she held a book, &ldquo;Ivanhoe.&rdquo; Miss
Dahlia had been reading it aloud the night before,
and the gypsy girl was eager to continue the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>She would find a sheltered spot, she thought, and
try to read it, although, as she well knew, many of
the words were long and hard.</p>
<p>The Barrington estate contained several acres.
Nan had never crossed to the high hedge that bounded
it on the farther side from town.</p>
<p>Great old trees lured her and wondering what
lay beyond the hedge, she started tramping in that
direction singing a warbling song without words.</p>
<p>A great old pepper tree with its glowing red berries
stood on the Barrington side, and Nan, gazing
up, saw one wide branch curving in a way that
would make of it a comfortable seat. Scrambling
up, she was soon perched there. Then she peered
through the thick foliage, trying to see what might
be in the grounds beyond.</p>
<p>It was another picturesque home of Spanish
architecture similar to the Barrington&rsquo;s with glowing
gardens and artistic groupings of shrubbery and
trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>There was no sign of life about the place, and
then Nan recalled having heard Miss Ursula say
that it was the home of Mrs. Warren Widdemere
a beautiful young widow possessing great wealth,
who was traveling in Europe trying to forget her
recent bereavement. Mrs. Widdemere had a son
who was in a military academy, and so, in all probability
the place was unoccupied, the girl thought, as
she opened her book, and began slowly and yet with
increasing interest, to read.</p>
<p>Half an hour later she became conscious that
there were voices near, and on the other side of the
hedge. Glancing through the sheltering green, she
beheld a woman in nurse&rsquo;s uniform who was pushing
a wheeled chair, in which sat a boy of about 16.
His face was pale and his expression listless; almost
discouraged, Nan thought.</p>
<p>As they neared the tree, a bell rang from the
house, and the nurse, leaving the chair, started up
the garden path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry back,&rdquo; the boy called languidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place will do for my sunbath as well as any
other.&rdquo; Then he leaned back, and, closing his eyes,
he sighed wearily.</p>
<p>Nan, prompted by pity and a desire to be friendly,
broke a cluster of pepper berries and tossed them
toward the chair. They fell lightly on the boy&rsquo;s
folded hands. He opened his eyes and looked
about, but he saw no one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor boy!&rdquo; Nan thought with a rush of
tenderness. The gypsy girl always had the same
pity when she saw anything that was wounded, and
it was this tenderness in her nature that had compelled
her to remain in the caravan for so long to
protect the little cripple Tirol.</p>
<p>The sick lad, believing that a cluster of pepper
berries had but fallen of its own accord once more
leaned back and closed his eyes, but he opened them
almost instantly and again looked about. From
somewhere overhead he heard a sweet warbling
bird-song. &ldquo;Perhaps a mocking bird,&rdquo; he was thinking
when the note changed to that of a meadowlark.</p>
<p>Gazing steadily at the tree ahead of him, he saw a
gleam of red and then a laughing face peering between
the branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you! Whoever you are, come down!&rdquo; His
querulous voice held a command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed sir. I don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; was the merry
reply. &ldquo;I am a bird with red and gold feathers and
I shall remain in my tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy smiled. It was the first time that he
had been interested in the five months since his
father had died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see the glimmer of your plumage through
the leaves,&rdquo; he called. Then changing his tone, he
said pleadingly, &ldquo;Lady Bird won&rsquo;t you please come
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan dropped lightly to the ground on the Widdemere
side of the hedge.</p>
<p>The lad looked at the beautiful dark-skinned maiden,
and then, little dreaming that he was speaking
the truth, he said, &ldquo;Why, Lady Bird, your dress
makes you look like a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am one!&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;My name is Gypsy
Nan. I am staying with the Barrington&rsquo;s for a
time.&rdquo; Then her dark eyes twinkled merrily as she
confided. &ldquo;Miss Ursula Barrington is trying to civilize me,
but she had to go away, and oh I am so
glad! It isn&rsquo;t a bit nice to be civilized, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy laughed. &ldquo;I know that I wouldn&rsquo;t be if
I could help myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wished
that I had been born a wild Indian or a pirate or
something interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan seated herself on a stump that would soon
be covered with vines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you are sick,&rdquo; she said with renewed
sympathy. &ldquo;I would be smothered, I know, if
I had to live all of the time in houses with so much
velvet, and portieres shutting out the wind and the
sun. Tell me what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am Robert Widdemere,&rdquo; he replied, and then
a shadow crept into the eyes that for a moment had
been gleaming with amusement as he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going to be well again. The doctor
does not know what is the matter with me; no one
does, but I can&rsquo;t eat, and so I might as well hurry
up and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked steadily at the lad for a moment
and then she said, &ldquo;Robert Widdermere, you ought
to have more courage than that. Of course you&rsquo;ll
die if you&rsquo;re just going to weakly give up. I don&rsquo;t
believe that you&rsquo;re sick at all. I think you have been
too much civilized. Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what you do.
Eat all you can, and get strong fast, and then we
will ride horseback over the mountains and I&rsquo;ll run
you a race on the coast highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be great!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed and
again his eyes glowed with a new eagerness.</p>
<p>The girl sprang up. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the old
mission bells are telling that it is noon. I must go
or Miss Dahlia will be waiting lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Robert Widdemere, I&rsquo;ll come again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The lad watched the gleam of red disappearing
through a gate in the hedge which he had pointed
out. Then a new determination awakened in his
heart. Perhaps it was cowardly to give up and die,
just because he was so lonesome, so lonesome for the
dad who had been the dearest pal a boy could ever
have.</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s father had died five months before and
his mother, a rather frivolous young widow, who
had always cared more for society than for her home,
had placed her sixteen-year-old son in a military
academy and had departed for Paris to try to forget
her loss in the gay life of that city, but Robert had
been unable to forget, and day after day he had
grieved for that father who had been his pal ever
since he could first remember. These two had been
often alone as the wife and mother had spent much
time at week-end house-parties in the country places
of her wealthy friends. No wonder was it that the
boy felt that he had lost his all.</p>
<p>At last, worn with the grief which he kept hidden
in his heart, his health had broken and a cablegram
from his mother had bidden him go with a nurse to
their California home at San Seritos, adding, that
if he did not recover in one month, she would return
to the States, but since it was only the beginning
of the gay season in Paris, she did hope that he
would endeavor to get well as soon as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The lad had read the message with a lack of interest
and to the attending physician he had said:
&ldquo;Kindly cable my mother to remain in France as I
am much better, but that I shall stay in California
for the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kindly doctor wondered at the message. He
had but recently come to San Seritos and he did not
understand the cause, as the old physician whose
place he had taken, would have understood it.</p>
<p>Robert Widdemere, without the loving tenderness
of a mother to help him bear his great loneliness,
did not care to live until he met Gypsy Nan. When
she had looked at him so reprovingly with
those dark eyes that could be so serious or dancingly
merry, and had said that it was cowardly for him to
give up so weakly he had decided that she was right.
He ought to want to live to carry out some of the
splendid things that his father had begun if for nothing else,
but now there was something else! He
wanted to get strong soon that he might ride horseback
with Nan over the mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>When Miss Squeers returned to push the wheeled
chair and its usually listless occupant back to the
house she was surprised to note that he looked up
with a welcoming smile. &ldquo;Nurse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you
know, I am actually hungry. Don&rsquo;t give me broth
tonight. I want some regular things to eat, beefsteak
and mashed potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A query over the wire brought a speedy reply
from the physician: &ldquo;Give the lad whatever he asks
for and note the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Doctor Wainridge called and the lad
asked:   &ldquo;Doctor, is there any real reason why I
cannot walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever, son, that I know of,&rdquo; the gentleman
replied, &ldquo;except that you have been too weak
to stand, but if you continue with the menu that you
ordered last night, you will soon be able to enter
the Marathon races. There is nothing physically
wrong with you, lad. I decided that you had made
up your mind that you did not care to get well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked around and finding that they were
alone, he confided, &ldquo;I did feel that way, doctor, but
now I wish to get well soon, and be a pirate or a
gypsy or something uncivilized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; the doctor said, as he arose to go.</p>
<p>On his way home he wondered what had aroused
Robert&rsquo;s interest in life, but neither he nor the
nurse could guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;LADY RED BIRD.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Again it was Saturday. Every day during the
past week Robert had walked, only a few steps at
first, but each day going a little farther. Too, each
afternoon he had eagerly watched at the pepper tree
for the appearance of his Lady Red Bird, but she
had not come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she only comes on Saturday,&rdquo; he thought
as he sat alone in his wheeled chair waiting and
watching.</p>
<p>Suddenly a rose hurled over the hedge and fell
on his book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, Lady Red Bird,&rdquo; he called joyously. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see you, but I know that you are there. Please
come over on this side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gate opened ever so little and Nan peered
through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Then skipping in front of him, she cried, with
her dark eyes aglow, &ldquo;Why, Robert Widdemere, you
don&rsquo;t look like the same boy. What have you done?
You look almost well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; the lad replied, smiling radiantly. &ldquo;I am
going to be well enough to ride up the mountain
road with you on Thanksgiving morning, and then
I will surely have something to be thankful for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gypsy Nan clapped her hands. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll ride
a race on the hard sand close to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; ejaculated the lad. &ldquo;That will be two
weeks from to-day. I&rsquo;ll have to order my portion
of beefsteak and mashed potatoes doubled, I guess.&rdquo;
Then he added with a merry twinkle, &ldquo;Promise me
that you&rsquo;ll wear the gypsy-looking dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will,&rdquo; Nan cried, &ldquo;for I love it.&rdquo; Then
she added, &ldquo;Robert Widdemere, you don&rsquo;t believe
that I am truly a gypsy, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad shook his head and his brown eyes were
laughing. &ldquo;Why, of course not Lady Red Bird!
Gypsies are interesting enough, in their way, but
they are not like you. They are thieves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>The girl sprang up from the stump on which she
had been seated, and her eyes flashed. &ldquo;They are
not all thieves, Robert Widdemere,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and
many of them are just as good and kind as gorigo
could be. Manna Lou was a beautiful young gypsy
woman long ago, when I first remember her, and
she could have had a much happier life if she had
hot chosen of her own free will to care for that
poor little cripple boy Tirol, and for the motherless
Nan. I wish I had not run away from the caravan
now. I hate the gorigo, who always call my people
thieves!&rdquo; Then turning to the amazed and speechless
lad, she inquired with flashing eyes, &ldquo;Are there
no thieves among your people? Indeed there are,
but they are not <i>all</i> called thieves! My Manna Lou
taught me not to steal, and I have never taken even
a flower that did not belong to me. I&rsquo;m going
back, Robert Widdemere! I&rsquo;m going back to
Manna Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl burst into a passion of tears as she
turned toward the gate. The lad, deeply touched,
forgetting his weakness, was at her side and placing
a hand on her arm, he implored, &ldquo;Oh Lady Red
Bird, forgive me. I see now how wrong it is to
condemn a whole race because of the few. Promise
me that you won&rsquo;t go back. It is knowing you that
has helped me to get well, and if you go away, I
will be lonelier than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>The boy had returned to his chair and he looked
suddenly pale and tired. Nan&rsquo;s heart was touched,
and she said, &ldquo;Robert Widdemere, now that you
know I am really a gypsy, do you still care for my
friendship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care more to be your friend, than for anything
else in the whole world,&rdquo; the lad said sincerely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll not go back to the caravan,&rdquo; she promised,
a smile flashing through the tears. &ldquo;Goodbye,
Robert Widdemere. I&rsquo;ll come again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These two little dreamed that the nurse, Miss
Squeers, hidden behind a clump of shrubbery, had
seen and heard all that had passed, nor could they
know that upon returning to the house, she had at
once written to the lad&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>When on the day following, Nan returned to the
little gate in the hedge, Robert Widdemere was
not seen. The nurse, having overheard the planned
meeting had ordered the horses hitched to the
easiest carriage and had insisted that the lad accompany
her on a drive. He was restless when
he realized that they were not to return at the hour
he had expected his Lady Red Bird to visit him, and
indeed, when at last, they did turn into the long
winding drive leading to his handsome home, he
was so worn and weary from having fretted because
he had been forced to do something he did
not wish to do, that he had a fever and had to go
at once to bed. Miss Squeers sent for the doctor
and drawing him aside, she confided all she had
found out. If she had expected an ally, she was
greatly disappointed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Doctor Wainridge exclaimed, his
kindly face shining. &ldquo;Nothing could be better.
A tonic is powerless compared to a lad&rsquo;s interest in
a lassie. But if he was so much better only yesterday,
because of this friendship, what has caused
the set-back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Squeer&rsquo;s thin lips were pressed together in
a hard line. &ldquo;Doctor Wainridge, you evidently do
not realize that this young person is a real gypsy.
You wouldn&rsquo;t have doubted it if you could have
seen her black eyes flash yesterday when Robert
Widdemere spoke disparagingly of the race.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The physician looked interested, and somewhat
amused. &ldquo;Indeed, I could imagine it!&rdquo; he said
with assurance. &ldquo;I had a gypsy boy for a patient
once and a fiery tempered lad, he was, but I liked
him. The fact is, I admire much about their life,
not everything of course. They do a little too much
horse trading, and sometimes they even trade without
the owners being aware of it.&rdquo; At that he
laughed, appearing not to notice that a ramrod could
not be standing stiffer or more erect than was Miss
Squeers. He continued as though amused at the
memory. &ldquo;It was down south when I was practicing
there. One of the southern colonels had a
thoroughbred horse. He boasted about it on all
occasions, but when the gypsies came and passed
they had traded an old boney nag with the colonel.
He found it in the paddock where his prize
racer had been locked in securely the night before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Miss Squeers snapped, &ldquo;I hope you are
not upholding such conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good-natured physician shook his head, but
his eyes were still twinkling. &ldquo;No, indeed not!&rdquo; he
said emphatically. &ldquo;That manner of horse trading
is not to be condoned in the slightest degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trading?&rdquo; With biting sarcasm Miss Squeers
spoke the word. &ldquo;Stealing, you mean. That&rsquo;s
what they all are, thieves and liars.&rdquo; Then with a
self-righteous expression on her drawn, white face,
the woman continued: &ldquo;Mrs. Widdemere puts her
entire trust in <i>my</i> judgment and until she comes
to relieve me, I shall not permit her son to again
speak to that gypsy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>The doctor narrowed his eyes, gazing thoughtfully
at the speaker. When she paused he exclaimed
&ldquo;Good Lord, Miss Squeers, what possible
harm could a girl of thirteen or fourteen do a sixteen
year old boy? I have heard the story of the
protege of the Misses Barrington. Indeed it has
been rumored about that she is very beautiful and
rarely talented. My wife is well acquainted with
the woman who is instructing the girl on the harp
and she has only enthusiastic praise for the gifts
with which she has been endowed. Nature is the
mother of us all, and is no respector of persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you advise me to permit this friendship to
continue even though I <i>know</i> it would greatly displease
Mrs. Widdemere who is among the proudest
of proud women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor thoughtfully twirled the heavy charm
on his watch chain. &ldquo;If we have to choose between
losing our patient and displeasing a vain mother, I
prefer the latter. You can see for yourself that the
boy has had a set-back. This is most discouraging
to me. And, as his physician, I shall have to ask,
as long as I have the case, and the boy&rsquo;s mother
cabled me to take it, that he be given his freedom
in the matter. Do not again force him to go for
a drive with you unless it is his wish to do so. I
will call again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>The nurse watched him go with a steely expression
in her sharp green-blue eyes. Next she
walked to a calender and marked on it the probable
day when she might expect a response to the letter
she had written Mrs. Widdemere.</p>
<p>Then she went upstairs and found her patient
tossing restlessly. After all, she decided it might
be better for her to follow the doctor&rsquo;s orders. She
would not have long to wait for orders from one
higher in authority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE DOCTOR TAKES A HAND.</span></h2>
<p>Doctor Wainridge had done a little thinking on
his own part and he arrived at the Widdemere
home early the next morning. Finding that the
boy was in a listless state, from which he had been
aroused only by his interest in his new friend, the
physician, after dismissing the nurse, sat down by
the bed-side and took the thin hand in his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert, lad,&rdquo; he began in a low voice that
could not possibly be overheard by an intentional
or unintentional eavesdropper, &ldquo;I hear that you
have made the acquaintance of that little gypsy
lady who is staying next door.&rdquo; The boy looked
up with almost startled inquiry. He had not supposed
that their meeting had been observed. Then
a hard expression shadowed his eyes. &ldquo;Huh,
I might have known that sly cat would pry around.
I suppose she told you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>The good-natured doctor wanted to laugh aloud.
He quite agreed with the boy&rsquo;s description of the
nurse, but, of course, it would not be ethical to
permit the patient to know this and so he said, assuming
an expression of professional interest merely:
&ldquo;Miss Squeers mentioned it to me, Robert, and
of course, in her capacity as nurse, she feels, in
the absence of your mother, that she should try,
if possible, to influence you against a friendship
that your mother might not wish you to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes flashed and he drew himself to a
sitting posture. &ldquo;Doctor Wainridge,&rdquo; he said vehemently,
&ldquo;how can I ever get well if I am kept a
prisoner with a jailor whom I hate, hate, hate!
Can&rsquo;t you dismiss Miss Squeers from my case and
just look after me yourself. Gee whiz, Doctor
Wainridge, aren&rsquo;t there servants enough around
this place to make me some broth and give me a
bath.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>The doctor glanced at the closed door and put his
fingers on his lips as a suggestion that the boy
speak in a lower voice. &ldquo;I cannot dismiss Miss
Squeers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because in your mother&rsquo;s cable
to me she asked that she be called, but, of course,
as you know, a doctor&rsquo;s orders must be carried out,
and so I now order, that, until your mother dismisses
<i>me</i>, you are to see as much of the little gypsy
girl as possible, if you find her companionship
amusing. You are merely children and as such need
young companionship.&rdquo; Then, after feeling the
lad&rsquo;s pulse and taking his temperature, he said
loud and cheerily, &ldquo;Well, Robert Widdemere, you
feel pretty well I judge. Fever&rsquo;s all gone and you
look rested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anything the matter with me yesterday
only I was mad, mad clear through.&rdquo; The
boy cast a vindictive glance at the closed door on
the other side of which they could both visualize
a wrathful nurse, trying, if possible, to hear the
conference she had been barred from. Then the
boy confessed. &ldquo;It was this way, Doctor Wainridge,
that nice girl, Lady Red Bird, the one next
door, told me that she would come back to the hedge
yesterday afternoon to ask how I was getting on,
and that nurse must have heard, for she took me
driving and kept me away until I was so angry
that it wore me all out, and I had a fever. Now,
what worries me is, will Lady Red Bird ever come
back again? It isn&rsquo;t a bit likely that she will. Girls
have too much pride to chase after a fellow, if he
isn&rsquo;t there when he says he will be. She&rsquo;ll think
I&rsquo;m a cad. I just know she won&rsquo;t come again, and
I wouldn&rsquo;t blame her if she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither would I blame her, Robert,&rdquo; the doctor
agreed. &ldquo;Now, laddie, listen to me. If you
will rest all this morning and eat a good lunch and
not be wrathful at your nurse whatever she may
say or do, I&rsquo;ll come over this afternoon and take
you to call on your new friend. I&rsquo;ve been planning
for ever so long to drop in and see Miss Dahlia.
I&rsquo;ve been their family physician more years than I
like to remember. Well, sonny, how does, that plan
strike you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked up brightly. &ldquo;Bully,&rdquo; he ejaculated.
Then anxiously he inquired, &ldquo;Shall you tell
the nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her to get you ready for a drive as I
shall call for you at two. Then I will let Miss
Dahlia know that I am to call on her at two-thirty
and would like to meet her prot&ecirc;ge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old doctor was indeed pleased to see how
quickly his suggestion brightened the lad&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Reaching out a thin hand, he took the big brown
one as he said; &ldquo;Doc, you&rsquo;re a trump! I needn&rsquo;t
feel that I haven&rsquo;t a friend when you&rsquo;re at the wheel.
Now I&rsquo;m going to rest hard until noon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">A PLEASANT CALL.</span></h2>
<p>Miss Squeers found it hard to follow orders
that were so against her own judgment. She well
knew Mrs. Widdemere, for had she not been in
that home during the illness of Robert&rsquo;s father and
had she not found his mother a woman after her
own heart! &ldquo;If a person is born an aristocrat,&rdquo;
the nurse told herself, &ldquo;she ought to act like one
and be haughty and proud. How would a peacock
look trying to put herself on a social footing with a
pullet?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>All the time that she was assisting Robert Widdemere
to dress for the drive that he was to take
with Doctor Wainridge, the woman&rsquo;s thin colorless
lips grew tighter and thinner. The physician
had not told where he was going to take their
patient, but she knew, as well as if she had been
able to hear through the closed door. She consoled
herself with the knowledge that her turn to
triumph would come in time. They did not know,
however much they might suspect it, that she had
written the mother all that she knew of this disgraceful
friendship. Doctor Wainridge would be
peremptorially dismissed, of that Miss Squeers was
certain. For that matter the doctor was sure of
the same thing, but what he hoped was that his
patient should by that time be so far along on the
road to recovery that he would not be harmed by
his mother&rsquo;s anger or subsequent action. That
Mrs. Widdemere would forbid the friendship, he
well knew. But his office, at present, was to help
the lad to rouse himself from the indifferent stupor
into which he had fallen since his father&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<p>The doctor arrived at two, and for half an hour
they drove about the picturesque country lane on
either side of which were the vast estates of the
wealthy dwellers of the far famed foot-hill section.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>At length they left the highway and turned into
the drive leading to the Barrington home. The
physician was saying:&mdash;&ldquo;I was up in the big city
when it all happened and so another doctor was
called when the accident occured. I am referring
to the accident which brought the gypsy girl into
the home where I presume she is to remain.&rdquo; Then
he laughed. &ldquo;It is well for the girl that the haughty
older sister has gone away for an indefinite stay
for she had undertaken, so the story goes, to civilize
and Christianize this little heathen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy nodded. &ldquo;Lady Red Bird told me. She
said she was just ready to run away because they
were going to put her in a convent school, when a
telegram came and Miss Ursula Barrington left
at once for the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they neared the house, they saw a very
pretty sight. The girl of whom they had been
talking, looking more then ever like a gypsy in
the costume she had worn when she had first arrived,
was dancing up and down the paths of the
glowing garden shaking her tambourine, as she
had danced on that never-to-be-forgotten day when
she had been there with little Tirol. Nearby on a
bench the younger Miss Barrington sat with her
lace crochet now and then dropping it to her lap to
smile at the girl. Suddenly she called. &ldquo;Nan, dearie,
the company has come.&rdquo; The girl dropped to a
marble bench, but a side glance toward the drive
showed her that both the doctor and the boy had
witnessed her performance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, Miss Dahlia,&rdquo; she said, tossing
her dark hair back and out of her eyes, &ldquo;I put this
dress on purposely that Robert Widdemere might
see I&rsquo;m not ashamed that I am a gypsy. I&rsquo;m proud,
proud, proud because I belong to Manna Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you are, dearie,&rdquo; the gentle little
woman rose and advanced to greet the newcomers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Wainridge,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad that
you have come to meet our dear adopted daughter.
It was a real regret to me that you were out of
town at the time of the accident, if something which
results in great joy and happiness can be called by
so formidable a name. And this,&rdquo; she held out a
slender white hand toward the glowing girl, &ldquo;is
our Nan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor, whose broad-brimmed black felt
was under one arm, shook hands with Miss Dahlia
and then with the girl. Turning, he beamed on
the lad as he said, &ldquo;Surely, Miss Barrington, you
remember this boy, although you may not have
seen him recently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do! Robert, how you have grown.&rdquo;
Then noting his pale face, she said with kindly
solicitude, &ldquo;You are not yet strong. Shall we go
into the house? Would it not be more comfortable
there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>But the doctor, after glancing at his watch replied:
&ldquo;I fear that I cannot remain today, as I have
other patients to see, but if you are willing to
entertain your young neighbor, I will return for
him in just one hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great of you,
doctor, to leave me in so pleasant a place.&rdquo; Then
turning to Miss Dahlia who was looking at him
pityingly, he confessed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored to death at
home with that specter of a nurse watching over
me for all the world like a vulture swinging around
the head of some poor creature that it expects is
soon to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor had been glancing about. There was
a summer house near in which there were comfortably
cushioned rustic chairs and a table. It was
where Miss Dahlia and Nan had their daily lessons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a pleasant place for you children
to go for a real visit, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he suggested.
Miss Dahlia nodded smilingly and Nan led the way
to the summer house. Miss Dahlia then walked
at the doctor&rsquo;s side toward his car as she wished
to ask his advice about her headaches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a great sport?&rdquo; Robert looked after his
friend and ally admiringly, then he blurted out:&mdash;&ldquo;Lady
Red Bird, that sly cat of a nurse was trying
to keep us apart. That&rsquo;s why I wasn&rsquo;t at the gate
in the hedge yesterday. If I&rsquo;d been strong enough
I would have walked over here when I reached
home and explained, but I was lots worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad glanced anxiously into the flushed face
of the girl. He feared she was hurt with him.
&ldquo;I say, Miss Nan, you&rsquo;ll forgive my not being
there. I wouldn&rsquo;t be such a cad, if I could help it.
You know that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was greatly relieved with the reply which
was, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t there myself, Robert Widdemere.
Miss Dahlia had one of her headaches and was so
sick I didn&rsquo;t wan&rsquo;t to leave her. I was sure you
would understand.&rdquo; Then, quickly changing the
subject, she added. &ldquo;This is a real comfortable
chair. It&rsquo;s where Miss Dahlia sits when she teaches
me to read. Oh, I love reading,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;and stories. I used to make them up out of my
head to tell Little Tirol and the other children.
Little wild foxes I called them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>There was a sudden far away wistful expression
in the girl&rsquo;s dark eyes as she gazed out of the vine-hung
door of the summer house, and the lad watching
her, wondered that he had ever doubted that
she was truly a gypsy. Surely, in that costume,
there could be no question about it.</p>
<p>He said gently, &ldquo;Lady Red Bird, I believe you
sometimes wish you could go back to the old life.&rdquo;
She turned wide startled eyes toward him as she
replied in a tense voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back when the
black dragon comes again. I won&rsquo;t stay here with
her. I won&rsquo;t be civilized for her. She doesn&rsquo;t love
me like Miss Dahlia does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t the wild gypsy life lure you?&rdquo; the
boy leaned forward interested. &ldquo;I always imagine
it as romantic and carefree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the girl looked at him startled, then replied
in a low voice. &ldquo;Would you think it was
romantic to have to do everything that a cruel,
black-hearted Anselo Spico and his demon mother
said to do? Would you call it being carefree when
you were thrashed till the blood came if you
wouldn&rsquo;t dance at the gorigo inns?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I staid till little Tirol died. Anselo Spico had
to beat me first, before he could get at that poor
little cripple. I staid to take little Tirol&rsquo;s beatings,
but when he was dead, I ran away and came here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Robert Widdemere hardly knew what to say.
&ldquo;Lady Red Bird, I thought you told me you were
proud of being a gypsy and that you loved the life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an instant change and springing up
she flung her arms wide with almost a wistful cry&mdash;&ldquo;I
love living out in the open, with only the starry
sky for a roof, and the branches of trees swaying,
swaying over my head when I sleep. I love to
ride on my pony Binnie away, away, away, to feel
my hair blowing in the wind and to have nothing
to do but live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like right well to be that
kind of a gypsy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to wander away,
away, away from nurses and houses and routine
studies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia appeared in the door and she was
followed by a maid with a tray. &ldquo;I thought you
children might like a tea party,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
if you do not mind, I will join you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hour was soon up and the doctor bore away
a very thoughtful lad. &ldquo;Lady Red Bird <i>is</i> a real
gypsy,&rdquo; he was thinking, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t believe she
will civilize.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">MYSTERIOUS REVELATIONS.</span></h2>
<p>That was the beginning of a series of visits.
Sometimes these two planned to meet on the beach
and always Nan wore her gypsy dress. Somehow
she was determined that her new friend should not
forget who she really was.</p>
<p>A week had passed and they were becoming well
acquainted. Being constantly questioned about her
past life, Nan had told many stories of the gypsies
and adventures.</p>
<p>They were sitting in the sun on the sand one
morning and Nan was being especially thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts, Lady Red Bird?&rdquo;
the boy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering where I will find the caravan
when I run away.&rdquo; She looked up, a strange
eagerness in her expressive dark eyes. &ldquo;I must
find them when I am eighteen for Manna Lou is
to tell me then about my own mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Hesitatingly the boy suggested: &ldquo;Would you be
greatly disappointed if she were to tell you that you
are not a real gypsy?&rdquo; He almost feared that she
would flare at him wrathfully as she had that first
time, when he had scoffed at the idea of her being
one. But instead, she turned toward him dark eyes
in which there was the light of a simple conviction.
&ldquo;There is no question about that. I asked Manna
Lou, and she said&mdash;&lsquo;It is real gypsy blood that has
given you that dark skin Leichen Nan.&rsquo; But more,
she would not tell. Manna Lou <i>never</i> lied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy leaned forward eagerly. &ldquo;But she
promised to tell you more when you were eighteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there <i>is</i> something to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I <i>am</i> a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy smiled. &ldquo;I believe you would be disappointed
if you found that you were not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am! Manna Lou said so. Manna Lou does
not lie.&rdquo; It was always like arguing in a circle.
From whatever point they started, they swung
back to that same statement which was final in the
mind of the girl. Suddenly the boy asked; &ldquo;Have
you always lived in California?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no!&rdquo; Nan replied. &ldquo;We fled from
Rumania. That is my country. There are many
gypsies in that land across the sea. Manna Lou
said there are more than 200,000 gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One word had attracted and held the attention of
the lad. &ldquo;Lady Red Bird, why did you say &lsquo;fled?&rsquo;
Did your band <i>have</i> to leave Rumania?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gleamed at him quickly, suspiciously. Then
she replied dully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose so!
Anselo Spico and his queen mother Mizella, they
do wrong things. They steal&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, and
the boy put in suggestively: &ldquo;Do they steal white
children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scornfully the girl flung back. &ldquo;No, never!
Horses here in this country, but over there it was
more&mdash;I never knew, something that made Anselo
Spico afraid. We traveled day and night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy said nothing but sat poking at the sand
with a stick. It looked very mysterious to him.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what that Spico, or whatever it
is you call him; you don&rsquo;t know what crime he had
committed that he left your native country so suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. &ldquo;And we didn&rsquo;t stop
in the East where we landed, but we came right on
and on and on till we reached California.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>The boy was thinking aloud. &ldquo;It seems strange
to me that the authorities where the boats stop
would permit wandering bands of gypsies to land
in this country without knowing what they come
for, or why they are leaving their own native land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, authorities? What are
they?&rdquo; The girl was plainly perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why when a big vessel arrives at Castle Garden
in New York, every passenger has been given
a permit to land from Ellis Island where they first
stop. Oh, there&rsquo;s a lot of red tape before anyone can
come ashore, and I should think a whole band of
gypsies would have considerable difficulty passing
the examiners, that is what I mean by authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Still the girl looked at him blankly as one who
did not understand. &ldquo;We landed in the night on a
lonely marshy shore. Florida they called it. The
sailing barge that brought us across the sea left
before daybreak, and when the sun came up we
were in our caravans riding across a flat lonely
country. We saw very few people because we slept
days and passed through the villages at night. The
gorigo police sometimes followed us to see that we
kept going until we were out of the town but nobody
stopped us. Then, for weeks and weeks we
were crossing the wide sandy desert. We camped a
long time in the Rocky Mountains. I never did
understand that, I mean why we seemed to be
hiding. I thought maybe Anselo Spico had stolen
something and we were waiting until it would be
safe to go on, but I heard Vestor report one night,
when he came back from town that there had been
no mail from Rumania and so I supposed that we
had been waiting there long enough for Anselo
Spico to write someone in Rumania and that we
were waiting for the reply. At last it came and
the message in that letter angered him terribly.
He seized a whip and began to lash poor little
Tirol. I threw myself on the child and he began
to beat me. It was his Queen Mother Mizella,
who stopped him by saying. I never forgot the
words though they meant nothing to me. &lsquo;Bedone
with that! You&rsquo;re like to kill her as may line your
purse yet.&rsquo; He snarled an answer, but he let us
both alone after that or at least he never beat me
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Robert Widdemere was more than ever convinced
that Nan had been stolen as a child and that the
gypsies were hoping someday to receive a rich reward
for her, but what he could not understand
was why, if that were true, it had been so long in
coming.</p>
<p>If she had own relations in Rumania, they surely
would have been glad to pay the ransom money
as soon as they found the whereabouts of the child.</p>
<p>But of his thoughts, he said nothing. After a
few moments, he asked; &ldquo;What did you do next,
Lady Red Bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our caravan left the mountains and we traveled
slowly westward. Manna Lou was kinder to me
than ever before, and she taught me to play on a
banjo which she said had belonged to my father.
She did not know much about it, but I was so glad,
glad to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;That was the last
mean thing Anselo Spico did to me. He found me
playing the banjo, and it seemed to anger him, or
some memory was called up by it that he did.
Anyhow he seized it and smashed it to pieces on
a rock. How I&rsquo;ve hated him ever since!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was one of the swift changes, and
Nan turned toward the boy a face softened and
beautified with tender memories. &ldquo;My father
played before the Queen of Rumania once and received
a medal. Manna Lou told me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>The boy was indeed puzzled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a mystery
and I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be able to fathom it,&rdquo; he
told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I am to be a musician, and I shall
play before a queen,&rdquo; the girl leaped to her feet and
was dancing about on the hard sand, startling to
flight a flock of shining winged white-gulls that
circled in the air over the sea. The boy also rose
and feeling much stronger, he tried to dance, but
was soon out of breath and laughingly sank back
on the sand higher up where it was dry and warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I need,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;is a costume
to match Lady Red Bird&rsquo;s. Then I will be able to
dance with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea pleased him, and he thought of it,
smiling to himself.</p>
<p>At last the hour came for their parting. &ldquo;Remember
our agreement. Tomorrow will be Thanksgiving
and we are to go for a horseback ride.&rdquo; Then
catching both hands of the girl, the boy looked into
her laughing eyes as he said with sincere earnestness.
&ldquo;If I have indeed regained my strength, I
have no one to thank but Lady Red Bird.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes you have. It was Doctor Wainridge
who brought you here. You must thank him as
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And also dear gentle Miss Dahlia,&rdquo; the lad
concluded, &ldquo;Good-bye until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE MOUNTAIN RIDE.</span></h2>
<p>Thanksgiving came and at the appointed hour
Nan was waiting at the beach gate when she saw
a gypsy riding toward her. Nan&rsquo;s first thought
was one of terror, for the approaching horseman
looked as Anselo Spico had when arrayed in his
best, a blue velvet corduroy suit, a scarlet silk sash
and a wide felt hat edged with bright dangles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robert Widdemere!&rdquo; Nan cried, when she
saw who it really was. &ldquo;You looked so like Anselo
Spico as you rode along by the sea, that I was about
to run and hide. Where did you get that costume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a shop in town where one may procure
whatever one wishes for a masquerade,&rdquo; the laughing
lad replied as he leaped to the ground and made
a deep, swinging bow with his gay hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it, Lady Red Bird,&rdquo; he enthusiastically declared,
&ldquo;and I do believe that I will purchase this
outfit. Won&rsquo;t we create a stir in the countryside
as we ride together down the Coast Highway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Nan laughed joyously. &ldquo;It becomes you, Robert
Widdemere,&rdquo; she said. It was hard for the girl to
believe that the handsome, flushed youth at her
side was the same pale sickly lad whom she had
first met less than a month before.</p>
<p>During that time these two had become well acquainted,
taking short walks together and reading
Ivanhoe while they rested. Miss Dahlia found that
her pupil was making remarkable progress under
her new tutor, moreover she liked the youth with
his frank, good-looking face and she was glad to
have Nan companied by someone near her own
age.</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia appeared at the beach gate to see them
off on their long planned ride and she called after
them, &ldquo;Robert, lad, be sure to come back and share
our Thanksgiving dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Dahlia, I would like to,&rdquo; the
youth replied doffing his hat. Then the little lady
watched them ride away and turn up the mountain
road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>In her heart there was a strange misgiving that
she could not understand. &ldquo;What if her sister,
Miss Ursula, should suddenly return,&rdquo; she thought.
Then indeed would Miss Dahlia be censored for
having permitted Nan to again assume the raiment
of a heathen.</p>
<p>Never before had Nan seemed more charming to
the lad than she did on that glorious morning when
side by side they rode up a narrow canon road
leading toward the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Nan,&rdquo; the young philosopher called, &ldquo;life
is full of contrasts. Now we are in a blaze of
warmth and sunlight, and, not a stone&rsquo;s throw
ahead of us, is the darkness and dampness of the
canon, where the pine trees stand so solemn and
still, like sentinels guarding the mysteries that lie
beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drew rein and gazed with big dark
eyes at the boy. During the past month she had
learned his many moods. In a serious voice she
said. &ldquo;I sometimes wonder how we dare go on,
since we do not know the trail that is just ahead.
I don&rsquo;t mean here,&rdquo; she lifted one hand from her
horse&rsquo;s head and pointed toward the high walled
canon in front of them. &ldquo;I mean, I wonder how
we dare go along life&rsquo;s trail when it is, so often,
as though we are blind-folded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Nan,&rdquo; he said, with
a note of tenderness in his voice which the girl always
noticed when he spoke of his father. &ldquo;Did
I ever tell you how my father loved the writings
of Henry Van Dyke? It didn&rsquo;t matter what they
were about, fishing, or hiking, or philosophising.
My father felt that they were kin, because they
both so loved the great out-of-doors. Just now,
when you wondered how we dare go ahead when
we cannot know what awaits us on life&rsquo;s trail, I
happened to recall a few lines which Dad so often
used to recite. They are from Van Dyke&rsquo;s poem
called &lsquo;God of the Open Air.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy gazed at the girl as though he were
sure of her appreciation of all he was saying. &ldquo;It
is a long poem and a beautiful one. I&rsquo;ll read it to
you someday, but the part I have in mind tells just
that how everything in nature has, planted deep in
its being, a trust that the Power that created it will
also care for it and guide it well. This is it:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;By the faith that the wild flowers show when they bloom unbidden;</p>
<p class="t0">By the calm of the river&rsquo;s flow to a goal that is hidden.</p>
<p class="t0">By the strength of the tree that clings to its deep foundation,</p>
<p class="t0">By the courage of bird&rsquo;s light wings on the long migration</p>
<p class="t0">(Wonderful spirit of trust that abides in Nature&rsquo;s breast.)</p>
<p class="t0">Teach me how to confide, and live my life, and rest.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is very beautiful,&rdquo; Nan said in a low voice
and then, starting their horses, they entered the
shadow of the mountain walls and slowly began
the ascent.</p>
<p>The trail became so narrow that they had to ride
single file for a long time. Each was quietly
thinking, but at last they reached a wide place
where the mountain brook formed a pool and at
the girl&rsquo;s suggestion they dismounted to get a
drink of the clear cold water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How peaceful and still it is here,&rdquo; Nan said as
she sat on a moss covered rock, and, folding her
hands, listened to the murmuring sounds of trickling
water, rustling leaves, and soughing of the
soft breeze in the pines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Robert, standing with his arms folded, had been
gazing far down the trail which they had just
climbed, but chancing to glance at the girl he saw
a troubled expression in her dark beautiful face.
Sitting on a rock near her, the boy leaned forward
as he asked eagerly. &ldquo;Nan, you aren&rsquo;t longing for
the old life, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned toward him with a smile that put
his fears at rest. &ldquo;Not that, Robert Widdemere. I
was wondering if I dare ask you a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Lady Red Bird, of course you may. I
will answer it gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy little dreamed how hard a question it
was to be. For another moment the girl was silent,
watching the water that barely moved in the pool
at her feet. Then in a very low voice she said;&mdash;&ldquo;We
gypsies do not believe in a God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although unprepared for this statement, the lad
replied by asking, &ldquo;What then do your people believe
gave life to all this?&rdquo; He waved an arm
about to include all nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They believe that there are unseen spirits in
streams and woods that can harm them, if they will.
Sometimes, when a storm destroyed our camp, we
tried to appease the wrath of the spirit of the tempest
with rites and charms. That was all. Manna
Lou had heard of the gorigo God, and often she
told little Tirol and me about that one great
Power, but if we asked questions, she would sadly
reply &lsquo;Who can know?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manna Lou was right in one way, Lady Red
Bird, we cannot know, perhaps, but deep in the
soul of each one of us has been implanted a faith
and trust just as the poem tells. I do know that
some Power, which I call God, brought me here
and so sure I can trust that same Power to care for
me and guide me if I have faith and trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden brightening of the girl&rsquo;s
face, &ldquo;Oh, Robert Widdemere,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am so
glad I asked you. I understand now better how it
is, I, also, shall trust and have faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She arose and mounted on her pony and they
began climbing the steeper trail which led to the
summit of the low mountain.</p>
<p>At last they rode out into the sunlight, and,
dismounting, stood on the peak of the trail.</p>
<p>Such beauty of scene as there was everywhere
about them. Beyond the coast range, across a wide
valley, there was still a higher and a more rugged
mountain range and beyond that, in the far distance,
a third, the peaks of which were scarcely
visible in the haze and clouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Then they turned toward the sea, which, from
that high point could be seen far beyond the horizon
that they had every day on the beach. &ldquo;Lady Red
Bird,&rdquo; the boy laughed, &ldquo;you will think me very
dull today, I fear, but I can&rsquo;t help philosophising
a bit at times. I was just thinking that when
troubles crowd around us, it would be a wonderful
thing, if, in our thoughts, we could climb to a high
place and look down at them, we would find that,
after all, they were not very large nor very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things do look small, surely,&rdquo; the girl said. &ldquo;See
the town nestling down there. The church steeple
seems very little from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the pepper tree where we first met,&rdquo; the lad
turned and took the girl&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I shall always
think of you as my Lady Red Bird,&rdquo; he told her.
Hand in hand they continued to stand as brother
and sister might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I see our marble fountain glistening in
the sun,&rdquo; Nan declared. Suddenly the boy&rsquo;s clasp
in the girl&rsquo;s hand tightened. &ldquo;Look, quick,&rdquo; he said
pointing downward, &ldquo;there is a limousine turning
from the highroad up into our drive. Who do you
suppose is coming to call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is your doctor,&rdquo; Nan suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>The lad laughed. &ldquo;No indeed. For one thing he
rides in an open run-about, and for another, he
told me that since I had made up my mind to get
well, he would have nothing more to do with me.
There are enough truly sick people he said, who
need his attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, who can it be?&rdquo; Nan persisted, but the
lad merrily declared that he knew not and cared
not. After gazing for a moment at the girl who
was still looking down at the highway he exclaimed
with mingled earnestness and enthusiasm. &ldquo;Nan,
you don&rsquo;t know how much it means to me, to
have a sister like you, a friend, or a pal, the name
doesn&rsquo;t matter. You&rsquo;re going to fill the place, in
a way, that Dad held, and truly he was the finest
man that ever trod the earth. Often he said to me
&lsquo;Son, when you give your word, stand by it. I
would rather have my boy honest and dependable,
than have him president,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m going to try,
Nan, to become just such a man as was my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s gaze had left the road and she looked
straight into the clear blue-grey eyes of the boy at
her side. &ldquo;I am glad, Robert Widdemere,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;for I could never be proud of a friend whose
word could not be depended upon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>The boy caught both of the girl&rsquo;s hands in his as
he said, &ldquo;Nan, listen to me, you have no older
brothers to take care of you, and as long as I shall
live, I want you to think of me as one to whom
you can always come. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who tries
to separate us, Nan, no one ever shall, I give you
my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears sprang to the eyes of the girl, but that she
need not show the depth of her emotion, she called
laughingly, &ldquo;Robert Widdemere, it is time that we
were returning, for even before we left, the turkey
had gone into the oven and we must not keep Miss
Dahlia waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; the lad gaily replied as again
they started down the trail, &ldquo;although a month ago
it would not have seemed possible, I am truly
ravenously hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the mountain road they went, these two
who so enjoyed each other&rsquo;s companionship, little
dreaming who they would find at the end of the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">SUDDEN CHANGES.</span></h2>
<p>Leaving their ponies at the stables, the two hand
in hand walked along the path in the glowing garden.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the yellow crysanthemums are at
their loveliest now,&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to gather an armful to put on the table that we may
have one more thing to be thankful for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, I&rsquo;ll help you!&rdquo; the boy broke a curling-petaled
beauty. &ldquo;Nan, these shall be our friendship
flowers. They seem so like you, so bright and
colorful; joyful within themselves, and radiating
it on all who pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girl&rsquo;s arms were heaped with the big
curling, glowing blossoms, the lad suddenly cried;
&ldquo;Lady Red Bird, I completely forgot something
very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the girl turned toward him to inquire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo; he took from his pocket a folding kodak,
&ldquo;I wanted to take a picture of you at the top of the
trail and I never thought of it until now. Please
stand still, there, just where you are, with the
fountain back of you and the crysanthemums all
around you. Don&rsquo;t look so serious, Nan. Laugh
won&rsquo;t you? There, I snapped it and you had not
even smiled. You had such a sad far away look.
What were you thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just happened to think of Little Tirol and
how I hope it is all true, that there is a God to care
for him and give him another body, one without
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sister,&rdquo; the boy said, &ldquo;you do have such
strange and unexpected thoughts. How did you
happen to think of Little Tirol now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was because I remembered that day
only two months ago, when he and I first came to
the garden. The yellow flowers were just beginning
to bloom and I wanted one so. I hoped he
knows now that I can gather them, a great armful
if I wish.&rdquo; Then the girl skipped toward the
house, as she called merrily: &ldquo;If you were ravenously
hungry on the mountain trail, what must you
be now, I hope we are not late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is someone watching us from a front
window,&rdquo; the boy said. &ldquo;I saw a curtain move. Miss
Dahlia would not do that, would she, Nan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so. It was probably the maid;
though I can&rsquo;t think what she would be doing in
the front room when it must be almost time to
serve dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Widdemere paused a moment at the vine
hung outside portal to speak with an old gardener
whom he had known since his little boyhood. Nan,
singing her joyous bird song without words,
climbed the stairs to the library and before she had
reached the door she called happily, &ldquo;Oh Miss
Dahlia, Robert Widdemere and I have had such a
glorious ride up the mountain road, and too, we
climbed to the very summit. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful&mdash;&rdquo;
she got no farther, for having entered the library
she realized that the fashionably dressed stranger
standing there was not the little woman whom she
so loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pardon me!&rdquo; the gypsy girl said. &ldquo;I
thought you were Miss Dahlia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, dearie,&rdquo; a trembling voice called as
that little lady appeared from the dinning room.
&ldquo;I was needed for one moment in the kitchen,&rdquo; she
explained, then turning toward the stranger she
said almost defiantly, &ldquo;Mrs. Widdemere, this is my
dearly loved protege, Nan Barrington. Nan, Robert&rsquo;s
mother has returned unexpectedly from
France.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and at great inconvenience to myself, I
can assure you, to forbid my son associating with
a common gypsy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia drew herself up proudly, and never
before had she so closely resembled Miss Ursula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Widdemere,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;kindly remember
that you are in my home, and that you are speaking
of my protege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Robert appeared and was puzzled
to see Miss Dahlia standing with a protecting
arm about Nan, and the proud angry tone of her
voice, he had never before heard. Then he saw the
other woman with a sneering smile on her vain,
pretty face, and he understood all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did you not receive the message
that I sent you? Did I not tell you that you
need not return to the States, that my health was
recovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Widdemere replied coldly, &ldquo;and
now I understand why you did not return to the
school where I had placed you. You, a Widdemere,
neglecting your education that you might associate
with one of a class far beneath you; but I forbid
you, from this day, ever again speaking to this
gypsy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s eyes flashed, but she replied proudly, &ldquo;Mrs.
Widdemere, you do not need to command. I myself
shall never again speak to one of your kind,&rdquo;
then turning, she left the library.</p>
<p>A few moments later, when Robert and his mother
were gone, Miss Dahlia went to the girl&rsquo;s room
and found her lying on her bed sobbing as though
her heart would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Miss Dahlia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no
use trying to make a lady of me. I&rsquo;m merely a
gypsy and I&rsquo;ll only bring sorrow to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little woman sat by the couch and tenderly
smoothing the dark hair, she said: &ldquo;Little girl, you
are all I have to love in the world. My sister is
too occupied with many things to be my companion.
It grieves me deeply to have you so hurt, but I
have thought out a plan, dearie, by which this may
all be prevented in the future. Tomorrow morning,
early, you and I are going away to a little town
in the East which was my childhood home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s sobs grew less and she passionately kissed
the hand that carressed her. The little lady continued:&mdash;&ldquo;I
will legally adopt you, and then, truly,
will your name be Nan Barrington. After that I
am going to send you to the Pine Crest Seminary,
which is conducted by a dear schoolmate of mine,
Mrs. Dorsey. I want you to permit me to select
your wardrobe, which shall be like that of other
girls, and no one there will dream that you are a
gypsy, for many there are who have dark hair and
eyes and an olive complexion. Will you do all this
for me, Nan darling, because I love you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s arms were about the little woman as she
said, &ldquo;How good you are to me, how kind! I&rsquo;ll
try again to be a lady for your sake, and I hope
that in time I&rsquo;ll be able to repay you for all that
you do for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That afternoon was spent in packing and the
next morning, soon after sunrise, Miss Dahlia and
Nan were driven away, but they did not leave a
forwarding address.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Robert Widdemere lifted the heavy iron knocker
of the Barrington home about nine o&rsquo;clock. He
wanted to ask Miss Dahlia&rsquo;s pardon, and to tell
Nan, that although he was about to return to the
Military Academy to please his mother, he would
never forget the promise he had made on the mountain,
that he would always be her brother and her
friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>When Robert learned that Nan was gone and
that he had no way of communicating with her,
he felt that again a great loss had come into his
life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">SCHOOL GIRLS.</span></h2>
<p>Several years have passed since that day in
California when Nan Barrington and Robert Widdemere
had parted so sadly and neither had heard
ought of the other in all that time.</p>
<p>Nan, in a home-like girls&rsquo; school near Boston,
The Pine Crest Seminary, had blossomed into as
charming a young lady as even Miss Ursula could
desire, and that proud woman, who had changed
little with the years, often gazed at the beautiful
dark girl, silently wondering if it might be possible
that Nan was not a real gypsy after all.</p>
<p>True to her promise to the dear Miss Dahlia,
Nan had worn quiet colors like the other gorigo
maidens, and, during the three and a half years that
she had been at the school, nothing had occurred that
would even suggest the roving life of her childhood,
but unfortunately an hour was approaching
when that suspicion would be aroused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>The Miss Barringtons remained during the winter
months in Boston, but they frequently visited
the school, and, during the summer, they took Nan
with them to their cabin on the rocky and picturesque
coast of Maine.</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon Miss Dahlia was seated
in the little reception room at the school and a maid
had gone in search of the girl. First she referred
to a chart in the corridor, which told where each of
the forty pupils should be at that hour, and then,
going to the music room, she tapped on the door.
The sweet strains of a harp drifted out to her, and
she tapped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; a singing voice called, and the door
opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Nan, it&rsquo;s your aunt, Miss Barrington,
who is waiting to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thank you, Marie!&rdquo; the happy girl exclaimed,
then, springing up from the seat by her
beautiful golden instrument, she said happily to
the friend who was standing near: &ldquo;Phyllis do
come with me and meet my Aunt. I am always
telling her about you, but you have been so occupied
with one task or another that I have never had the
opportunity to have you two meet each other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Then as she covered her harp, she continued:
&ldquo;My Aunt Dahlia believes you to be as beautiful as
a nymph and as joyous as a lark.&rdquo; Then whirling
and catching both hands of her friend, Nan cried,
&ldquo;And when Aunt Dahlia really sees you, what do
you suppose she will think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m a frumpy old grumpy, I suppose,&rdquo;
Phyllis laughingly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not!&rdquo; Nan declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most
beautiful creature that Nature ever fashioned with
sunshine for hair, bits of June sky for eyes, the
grace of a lily and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan, do stop! I&rsquo;ll think that you are making
fun of me, and all this time your Aunt Dahlia
waits above. Come let us go. I am eager to meet
her.&rdquo; These two girls had been room-mates and
most intimate friends since Phyllis came to the
school at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>No two girls could be more unlike as Nan had
said. She was like October night, and her friend
was like a glad June day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Dahlia, dearie,&rdquo; Nan exclaimed a few
moments later, as she embraced the older lady,
&ldquo;here at last is my room-mate, Phyllis. You are
the two whom I most love, and I have so wanted
you to know each other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you look just exactly as I knew you would
from all our Nan has told me about you. Just as
sweet and pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia&rsquo;s kind face did not reveal that she
was even a day older than she had been that
Thanksgiving nearly four years before.</p>
<p>Nan asked about Miss Barrington, the elder and
was told, that, as usual, she was busy with clubs
of many kinds. &ldquo;We are very unlike, my sister, and
I,&rdquo; the little lady explained to Phyllis, &ldquo;I like a quiet
home life, Ursula is never happier than when
she is addressing a large audience of women, and it
does not in the least fluster her if there are men
among them, on weighty questions of the day. Yes,
we are very unlike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you are.&rdquo; Nan nestled lovingly
close to the little old lady. &ldquo;Not but that I greatly
admire and truly do care for Aunt Ursula. She
has been very kind to me since she began to like
me.&rdquo; Nan laughed, then stopped as though she
had been about to say something she ought not, as
indeed she had been. She had nearly said that her
Aunt Ursula had started to really like her when
she felt that the girl had been properly civilized
and Christianized, for, ever since the talk she had
had with Robert Widdemere, Nan had really tried
in every way to accept the religion of the gorigo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Dahlia,&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;what
do you suppose is going to happen? The music
master has offered a medal of gold to the one of us
whose rendering of a certain piece, which he has
selected, shall please him the most at our coming
recital. Phyllis is trying for it on the violin;
Muriel Metcalf and I on the harp, and Esther
Willis on the piano. I do hope you and Aunt
Ursula will be able to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but illness could keep me away,&rdquo; Miss
Dahlia said as she rose to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">OLD MEMORIES REVIVED.</span></h2>
<p>The two girls with arms about each other
stood on the front veranda watching as Miss Dahlia
was being driven along the circling drive. Nan
knew that she would turn and wave at the gate.
A moment later she saw the fluttering of a small
white handkerchief. The girls waved their hands,
then turned indoors and climbed the wide, softly
carpeted stairway and entered the room which
they shared together.</p>
<p>It was a strange room for each girl had decked
her half of it as best suited her taste. On one side
the birds&rsquo; eye maple furniture was made even daintier
with blue and white ruffled coverings. There
was a crinkly blue and white bedspread with pillow
shams to match, while on the dresser there was an
array of dainty ivory and blue toilet articles, two
ivory frames containing the photographs of Phyllis&rsquo;
father and mother, and a small book bound in blue
leather in which she wrote the events of every day.
There were a few forget-me-nots in a slender, silver
glass vase, and indeed, everything on that side
of the room suggested the dainty little maid who
occupied it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>But very unlike was the side occupied by the
gypsy girl. Boughs of pine with the cones on were
banked in one corner. Her toilet set was ebony
showing off startlingly on the bureau cover which
was a glowing red.</p>
<p>There were photographs of Aunt Dahlia and
Aunt Ursula in silver band frames, gifts to her
from the aunts themselves, but on the walls there
were pictures of wild canon places, long grey
roads that seemed to lure one to follow, pools in
quiet meadowy places, and a printed poem beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, to be free as the wind is free!</p>
<p class="t0">The vagabond life is the life for me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>But the crowning touch was the gorgeous crimson
and gold shawl with its long fringe mingled
with black threads that was spread over her bed.
Every girl who came into their room admired it,
many asked questions about how it came into Nan&rsquo;s
possession, but to one and all the gypsy girl gave
some laughing reply, and as each and every explanation
was different, they knew that she was inventing
stories to amuse them. Indeed, Nan was
often called upon, when storms kept the girls within
doors, to invent tales for their entertainment as they
sat about the great stone fireplace in the recreation
hall, and the more thrilling the tales were, the more
pleased her audience. Sometimes Nan recalled
another group, to whom she had, in the long ago,
so often told stories. Little dark, fox-like creatures
with their unkempt hair hanging about their
faces. How eagerly they had followed Nan&rsquo;s every
word. Poor little neglected things! Nan often
longed to be able to do something for them all,
to give them a chance to make something of themselves
as she had been given a chance.</p>
<p>But would they want it? Had she not rebelled at
first when Miss Ursula tried to civilize and Christianize
her?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Having entered their room, the gypsy girl went
at once to the wide window and looked out across
the school grounds where the trees and shrubs were
still leafless. &ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Spring is in the
air and calling us to come out. I don&rsquo;t want to
practice now. Suppose we climb to the top of
Little Pine Hill that looks down on the highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ought to study my French verbs.&rdquo; Phyllis
hesitated&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;French verbs on Saturday?&rdquo; Nan protested,
&ldquo;When a merry breeze waits to run us a race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fair maiden laughingly donned her wraps
and a few moments later these two were tramping
across the fields, and then more slowly they began
climbing the path that led over the little hill.</p>
<p>There they stood side by side gazing down at the
winding highway which, a short distance beyond,
was entirely hidden by a bend and a massing of
great old pines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t bends in the road interesting?&rdquo; Nan
said. &ldquo;One never knows what may appear next.
Let&rsquo;s guess what it will be, and see who is nearest
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Phyllis replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll guess that it&rsquo;s
the little Wharton girl out horse-back riding with
her escort. She passes almost every afternoon at
about this hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll guess that it will be a motoring party
from Boston in a handsome limousine,&rdquo; Nan replied.
Then hand in hand these two girls stood
intently watching the bend in the road.</p>
<p>Several moments passed and Nan&rsquo;s attention had
been attracted skyward by the flight of a bird, when
she heard Phyllis&rsquo; astonished exclamation: &ldquo;We
were both wrong, Nan! Will you look? I never
saw such a queer equipage as the one which is coming.
A covered wagon drawn by black horses and
there is another following it and still another. How
very curious! Did you ever see anything like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis was so intently watching the approaching
wagons that she did not notice the almost frightened
expression that had appeared in the dark eyes
of the girl she so loved, but after a moment Nan
was able to say quite calmly, &ldquo;Why, yes, Joy, I
have seen a gypsy caravan before. In California
where it is always summer, they often pass the Barrington
home in San Seritos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to the school
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her friend looked at her anxiously, &ldquo;Why dear,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;do you feel faint or ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan shook her head and remarked lightly, with
an attempt at gaiety: &ldquo;Maybe my conscience is
troubling me because I&rsquo;m keeping you from the
French verbs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>They returned to the school, and although Phyllis
said nothing, she was convinced that the sight of
the gypsy caravan had in some way affected Nan.</p>
<p>The truth was that the gypsy girl&rsquo;s emotions had
been varied and conflicting. Her first impulse had
been to run and hide, as though she feared that she
might be discovered and claimed, but, a second
thought assured her that this could not be the caravan
of Queen Mizella and her cruel son Anselo
Spico, for had she not left them in far-away California?</p>
<p>And yet, as she gazed intently at the wagon in
the lead, again came the chilling thought that it
was strangely familiar, and then she recalled a
memoried picture of one evening around the camp
fire when Anselo had expressed a desire to some
day return to Rumania, and, to do so, they would
have to come to the Eastern States.</p>
<p>Then another emotion rushed to the heart of the
watching girl. She remembered with tenderness
the long years of loving devotion that Manna Lou
had given her. She wondered if that kind gypsy
woman had missed her when she ran away. Tears
rushed to her eyes as she thought how selfish she
had been. She should have tried long ago to let
Manna Lou know that all was well with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Then it was that Nan decided to go close to the
highway, and, from a hiding place watch the caravan
as it passed, but she wanted to go alone. If
it should be the band of Queen Mizella, then Nan
would try in some way to communicate with Manna
Lou.</p>
<p>With this determination in her heart, she had
suggested to return to school. Phyllis who was
really glad to have an opportunity to study her
French verbs, went back willingly, but she glanced
often at the dark face of the friend she so loved.
She could not understand why Nan had suddenly
lost her merry mood and had become so quiet and
thoughtful.</p>
<p>Luckily for the gypsy girl&rsquo;s plan, the French
teacher, Madame Reznor, delayed Phyllis in the
lower corridor, and Nan, leaving them, hurried to
her room. Taking from the closet a long, dark
cloak with a hood-cape, she slipped it on, and looking
cautiously about the upper corridor to be sure that
she was unobserved, she tripped lightly down the
back stairs and out at the basement door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>She heard a gong ringing in the school, and she
was glad, for it was calling all the pupils to the
study hall, and there would be no one to spy upon
her actions. But she was mistaken, for two of the
girls who had been for a cross-country hike were
returning, and one of them, Muriel Metcalf, chanced
to glance in that direction just as Nan crouched
behind the hedge that bordered the school grounds
on the highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daisy Wells,&rdquo; Muriel exclaimed, &ldquo;how queerly
Nan Barrington is acting. Let&rsquo;s watch her and see
what she is going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This they did, standing behind a spreading pine
tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">A GYPSY CAMP.</span></h2>
<p>Several moments Nan Barrington waited
crouching behind the hedge, but the caravan did
not come, nor did she hear the rattle and rumble of
approaching wagons. Perhaps after all they had
passed while she was indoors. Disappointed, the
girl arose, and was about to return to the school
when she heard voices that seemed to come from a
small grove beyond the seminary grounds. Hurrying
along in the shelter of the hedge, Nan reached
a small side gate, and, hidden, she looked up the
highway.</p>
<p>She saw that the gypsies had drawn to one side
of the road and were preparing to make camp for
the night. They were so near that she could plainly
hear what they were saying and see the faces that
were strange to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Muriel Metcalf and Daisy Wells were more puzzled
than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose it is that Nan sees?&rdquo;
Muriel whispered. &ldquo;She surely is much excited
about something. Come, let&rsquo;s run to the tree that&rsquo;s
nearest the hedge and then we will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This they did, watching Nan intently, to be sure
that they were not observed, but the gypsy girl
looked only at the camp wondering what she should
do. At last, assured that she had nothing to fear,
and longing, if possible, to hear some word of Manna
Lou, who had mothered her through the first
fourteen years of her life, she drew her cloak more
closely about her, and, opening the gate, she went
over to the camp fire.</p>
<p>How familiar it all seemed. There were the
same little fox-like children scampering about
gathering wood, and tears rushed to Nan&rsquo;s eyes as
she remembered, how in the long ago, those other
children had always run to meet her with arms outstretched
when she returned to camp on her Binnie,
but these children paid her little heed, for often
fine young ladies come to have their fortunes told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>A kindly-faced gypsy woman, who was bending
over the fire, looked up as she said, &ldquo;Ah, pretty
leicheen, have you come to cross my palm with silver?
A wonderful future awaits you, dearie. I can
tell that from your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to the amazement of all within hearing,
Nan replied in the Romany language. The gypsy
woman held out her arms with evident joy as she
said in her own tongue, &ldquo;So, pretty leicheen, you
are one of us! Tell me, dearie, how did it happen?
Was your mother a gypsy and your father, perhaps
a gorigo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother was a gypsy,&rdquo; the girl replied, &ldquo;but
she has long been dead and I have been adopted by
a kind gorigo lady, two of them, and I am attending
this school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other gypsy women gathered about and they
urged Nan to remain with them for the evening
meal, but she said that she would be missed from
the school if she were not there for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is much that I want to ask you,&rdquo; the
girl said, &ldquo;and if I possibly can, I will return after
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, dearie leicheen,&rdquo; the gypsy women
urged, &ldquo;We will be glad to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Then, as it was late, Nan hurried away. The
twilight was deepening and though she passed close
to their hiding place, she did not see the two girls
who had been spying upon her.</p>
<p>When she was gone, Muriel exclaimed, &ldquo;Daisy
Wells, did you hear her? She spoke the gypsy language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; her friend replied. &ldquo;I have always
thought that there was something strange about Nan
Barrington and now I know what it is. She is a
gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is true, one of us will leave this school,&rdquo;
Muriel said haughtily, &ldquo;for my mother would not
permit me to associate with a common gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">AN ENEMY.</span></h2>
<p>During the dinner hour Phyllis glanced often
at her dearest friend wondering, almost troubled,
at the change that had so recently come over her.
Across the wide refectory, two other pairs of eyes
were also watching Nan and in the proud face of
Muriel Metcalf there was a sneering expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How guilty Nan Barrington acts,&rdquo; she said
softly to the girl at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She dreads having the truth found out, I suppose,&rdquo;
Daisy Wells replied, &ldquo;but probably we are
the only ones who know it and of course we would
not tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s pale blue eyes turned toward her friend
and her brows were lifted questioningly, as she inquired:&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed?
Who said that we would not
tell?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; Daisy replied quietly. &ldquo;My mother
has told me to ask myself two questions before repeating
something that might hurt another. First,
is it kind; second, is it necessary? So, Muriel, why
tell, since it is neither kind nor necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daisy&rsquo;s natural impulses were always good, but
she often seemed to be easily led by her less conscientious
friend, Muriel Metcalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, you may side with her if you prefer,&rdquo;
the other said with a shrug of her shoulders, &ldquo;but
I shall watch her closely tonight and see what she
does. I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if she went back
to the gypsy camp, and, as for telling, I shall do
as I think best about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To herself Muriel added, &ldquo;If Nan Barrington
wins the gold medal at the recital contest next Saturday,
it shall be known all over the school before
night that she is only a gypsy.&rdquo; Wisely, she said
nothing of this to Daisy Wells, whose sense of justice,
she knew, would scorn such an act of jealousy.</p>
<p>Nan was planning, as soon as she left the dining
hall, to go at once to the office of Mrs. Dorsey and
ask permission to go out of grounds, and, since
she was an honor student, she knew the request
would be granted without question. As the girls
were sauntering through the corridors after dinner
in groups of two and three, Phyllis exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Nan dear, the wonderful night has arrived
at last,&rdquo; and then when her friend&rsquo;s dark eyes
were turned toward her questioningly, she added
merrily, &ldquo;Nan Barrington, do you mean to tell me
that you have forgotten what we are to do tonight?
Why only this morning you said how glad you were
that the day had at last arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that Nan recalled the long-planned
and much-anticipated theatre party. Madame Reznor
was to chaperone her class in dramatics that
they might see a noted actor in a Shakespearian
play which they were studying.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of the gypsy caravan, she
had forgotten all else.</p>
<p>What should she do? Nan, who had never told
a lie, could not say that she was ill or that she did
not want to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, dear,&rdquo; Phyllis was saying, &ldquo;I will help
you dress as we are to start in half an hour. The
rest of us dressed before dinner, but though I
hunted everywhere, I could not find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan permitted herself to be led to their room and
mechanically she let down her long dark hair. Suddenly
the thought came to her that she would
awaken at dawn and slip out to the camp and then
she could ask her gypsy friends if they knew
aught of her Manna Lou.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Half an hour later, trying to assume a spirit of
merriment that she might not mar the joyousness
of the others, Nan climbed into the waiting car that
was to take them to the city. Muriel watched her
go, then turning to Daisy Wells, she said, &ldquo;Now,
you and I are going down to the gypsy camp and
find out what it was that Nan Barrington said
when she was talking in that queer language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl looked up from the problem that
she was trying to solve, as she replied, &ldquo;No Muriel,
I am not going. I promised little Janet that I would
help her with her sums tonight. She has been ill
and is eager to catch up with her class, and, moreover,
I have no desire to spy upon actions of a
schoolmate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; Muriel said with a toss of her
head and then she added sarcastically, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
afraid that you will soon be sprouting wings? It
seems to me that you have become a saint very
suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Daisy had arisen and was gathering up her books
and papers as she quietly replied, &ldquo;No, Muriel, I
am not pretending to be better than anyone else,
but I like Nan Barrington, no one could help liking
her, she is so kind and generous, and I do not in
the least care what her ancestry may be. Yes,
Janet dear, I&rsquo;m coming right away,&rdquo; she added to
the frail little girl who had appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>Muriel, left alone, put on a long cloak, and,
winding a scarf about her head, she went out. Well
she knew that it was against the rules to go beyond
the seminary grounds at night, but she did not
care. Something was all wrong in the heart of
Muriel Metcalf, and that something was jealousy
which was rapidly becoming hatred. She had so
wanted to win the medal of gold, but she knew that
Nan Barrington had practiced far more conscientiously.
Vaguely Muriel thought that, perhaps, if
she could find out something against Nan, she might
have her barred from the coming contest.</p>
<p>Having reached the gate in the hedge, Muriel
peered through, and saw, in the light of the camp fire,
the gypsies sitting close about it, for the night
was cold. When the girl approached, one of the
gypsy women rose and called in greeting, &ldquo;Ha,
pretty leicheen, I feared you were not coming.&rdquo;
Then, as the firelight fell on the face of the girl, she
added truly disappointed, &ldquo;but you are not the same.
Could she not come, the other little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Muriel replied. &ldquo;She wished me to say
that she had to go into the city.&rdquo; Then eager to obtain
the information for which she had come, she
added hurriedly, &ldquo;Nan Barrington tells me that she
too, is a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the pretty leicheen is one of us.&rdquo; Then, in
a wheedling voice, the gypsy woman said, &ldquo;Let me
tell your fortune, dearie. Cross my palm with silver.
I see much happiness for you, but it is far
off. First there is trouble. You are trying to
harm someone who is your friend, someone who is
to do much to help you. You should not do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s eyes flashed as she said haughtily. &ldquo;I
did not come here to have my fortune told. Thanks
to you I have learned what I wished to know.&rdquo;
Then, without another word, she walked rapidly toward
the side gate, but her heart was indeed
troubled; she could not understand why, or would
not, and it was late before she fell asleep. Too, it
was late when Phyllis and Nan Barrington returned
to their room and Nan&rsquo;s last conscious thought was
that she wanted to waken before daybreak that she
might visit the gypsy camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">NAN DISAPPOINTED.</span></h2>
<p>In spite of her resolve to waken before dawn,
Nan did not open her eyes until the sunlight was
flooding in at the wide bow window. Springing
up, she began at once to dress quietly, and then,
with a last glance at Phyllis who seemed to be sleeping
she left the room, but her friend had opened
her eyes in time to see Nan stealing out so silently.</p>
<p>However, this was not unusual, for the gypsy
girl, who in her childhood had always been up to
greet the dawn, often went to the top of Little Pine
Hill to watch the sunrise and to remember many
things, and so since it was still too early to dress,
Phyllis nestled back for another few moments of
slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Meanwhile Nan, with the dark cloak wrapped
snugly about her, for the morning air was tinglingly
cold, hurried across the wide grounds and
down to the hedge near the highway, but she paused
at the gate and gazed, not at the caravan as she
had hoped, but at the charred remains of the camp fire.</p>
<p>Her gypsy friends were gone! Truly disappointed,
she was about to return when she saw
something white pinned to a great pine tree, and
wondering what it could be, she slipped through the
gate and looked at it more closely. It was a piece
of folded wrapping paper addressed to &ldquo;The Pretty
Leicheen.&rdquo; She was sure that it was intended for
her. The kind gypsy woman had left some message.
Opening it, she read: &ldquo;We could not wait,
dearie. We must be in the next town by noon. A
girl from the school came to us last night. She
tries to harm you. If you are not happy, come to
us. We will be there until tomorrow, Queen
Luella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan folded the paper again and placed it in her
pocket. Then she stood looking down the highway,
shining in the sun, and there were many
emotions in her heart, but she was most conscious
of a loneliness, for once more she had lost a possible
opportunity of hearing about her dear Manna
Lou. If only she had Binnie, she could gallop after
the caravan and soon overtake it, but the pony, that
had been her comrade in those other days, was still
at San Seritos. Then, with a sigh, she turned back
and slowly crossed the school grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Happening to slip her hand into the pocket of her
coat, she touched the folded paper and then she remembered
the message that it contained. What
could Queen Luella have meant? She, Nan Barrington,
had an enemy? Nan wished harm to no
one and she always tried to be kind, then why
should there be someone wishing to harm her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, early bird,&rdquo; Phyllis sang out as Nan entered
their room, &ldquo;what did you capture this morning?
Wet feet, for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; the gypsy girl gaily replied as
she threw off the long wrap and sat on a low stool
to change her shoes. The cloak fell over a chair
and from the pocket a paper fluttered to the floor
near Phyllis.</p>
<p>Nan hurriedly reached for it and tearing it into
small bits, she tossed the pieces into a waste basket.
Her friend was indeed puzzled. It was so unlike
her room-mate to have secrets. What could it all
mean? She wondered as she gazed into the mirror
and brushed her long, sunlit hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Phyllis felt a desire to go to her friend and put
her arms about her and beg to be allowed to help
if anything had gone wrong, but she did not for
she well knew that Nan would tell her if it were
something that she wished to share.</p>
<p>The gypsy girl said suddenly after several
moments of deep thought, &ldquo;do you think that I
have an enemy in this school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An enemy? <i>You</i>, Nan? No indeed! Everyone
loves you! How could they help it? You are
always doing nice things for the girls and I never
heard you say an unkind word about anyone, so
how could you have an enemy?&rdquo; Phyllis was
amazed at the suggestion.</p>
<p>Nan rose and laughingly embraced her friend.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she merrily declared, &ldquo;it is quite evident
that you, at least, are not that enemy. Don&rsquo;t think
anything more about it. I was sure that I did not
have one. Good! There&rsquo;s the breakfast bell.&rdquo;
But, try as she might to forget, she could not, and
during the morning meal, Nan&rsquo;s glance roamed
from one face to another as she wondered who
among the pupils of Pine Crest Seminary had, the
night before, visited the gypsy camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">THE POWER OF LOVING-KINDNESS.</span></h2>
<p>The next afternoon at four, Nan went down to
the music room as it was her hour to practice on
the harp, Muriel Metcalf having been there the hour
preceding. Before opening the door, Nan listened
to be sure that the other young harpist had finished,
and, as she heard no sound within, she decided that
Muriel had gone, but, upon opening the door, she
saw the other girl seated by a table, her head on
her arms and her shoulders shaken with sobs.</p>
<p>Muriel sprang up when she heard the door close
and in her pale blue eyes there was an expression
of hatred when she saw who had entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, what has happened?&rdquo; Nan Barrington
exclaimed with her ever-ready sympathy. Then,
putting a loving arm about the girl, she added: &ldquo;Is
there something that I can do to help?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Muriel flung out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably
be glad when you hear what has happened.
That horrid old Professor Bentz told me that if I
did not have this week&rsquo;s lesson perfect, he would
no longer teach me on the harp. I suppose I am
stupid, but I just can&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t get it, and tomorrow
is the day that he comes. I wouldn&rsquo;t care for myself,
but my father will be heart-broken. He had a
little sister, who played on the harp, and she died.
Dad just idolized her, the way he does me. He
kept the harp and he is so eager to have me play
upon it. I just can&rsquo;t bear to disappoint him.&rdquo; For
the moment Muriel seemed to have forgotten to
whom she was talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor shall you,&rdquo; Nan said quietly. &ldquo;Is this
your free hour, Muriel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you would like to stay while
I practice. Our lesson is hard this week, but I
might be able to help you. Would you like to
stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel hardly knew how to reply. Judging
others by her own selfish standard, she had supposed
that Nan would be glad if she were barred
from the coming recital, but instead, the gypsy girl
was offering to help her master that part which
had seemed to her most difficult.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will stay,&rdquo; she heard herself saying,
and then she sat quietly near while Nan played
the lesson through from beginning to the end.
&ldquo;Now, Muriel,&rdquo; the harpist said, with her friendly
smile, &ldquo;will you play it for me, and then I can
better tell which part is your stumbling block?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patiently Nan showed the other girl how to correct
her mistakes, until, at length, a gong rang in
the corridor calling them to the study hall.</p>
<p>Springing up, the gypsy girl exclaimed: &ldquo;You
did splendidly, Muriel! If I could help you just
once more before your lesson, I think that Professor
Bentz would have no fault to find with you.&rdquo;
Then she added kindly, &ldquo;You really have talent,
dear, but you haven&rsquo;t practiced very faithfully of
late. If you wish, I will come with you to the
music room this evening during our recreation hour
and we can go over it once again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! I would like to come,&rdquo; Muriel replied,
but oh, what a strangely troubled feeling
there was in her heart as she remembered the words
of the gypsy woman: &ldquo;You are trying to harm
someone, who will do much to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>That evening at 7 o&rsquo;clock the two girls were
again in the music room and Muriel played
the piece through so well that Nan exclaimed with
real enthusiasm, &ldquo;Dearie, you did that beautifully,
especially the part where it seems as though a restless
spirit is yearning to be forgiven for something.
Really, Muriel, the tears came into my eyes, for
you played it with true feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to the gypsy girl&rsquo;s surprise the little harpist
began to sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, I do want to be forgiven for something.
You&rsquo;ve been so kind to help me and I&rsquo;ve
been so horrid and mean to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Muriel, you have never been horrid or
mean to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have. Only yesterday I was planning
to do something that I thought would turn
the girls all against you. I was jealous, I suppose,
because Professor Bentz always holds you up
as a model. Then I overheard you talking to the
gypsies and that night I visited their camp and
found out that you were one of them, and so I decided
that if you won the gold medal I would tell
every one in the school about it. There now, don&rsquo;t
you call that being mean and horrid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s joyous laugh rang out, and she gaily exclaimed:&mdash;&ldquo;Oho,
so you are the enemy I have been
looking for?&rdquo; Then she added, with sudden seriousness:
&ldquo;My dear Muriel, I am not ashamed because
I am a gypsy, and I would gladly have proclaimed
it from the top of Little Pine Hill if I had not
promised Miss Barrington that I would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to forgive me?&rdquo; Muriel asked,
although she knew the answer before it was
spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to forgive. Hark! Someone is
coming. Who do you suppose that it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a merry rapping on the door, and then
it was opened, revealing two maidens. There was
an expression of surprise on the pretty face of the
younger girl, but it was Phyllis who exclaimed,
&ldquo;Well, Nan, here you are. I have hunted for you
high and low. I just met Daisy in the corridor and
she was searching for Muriel.&rdquo; Then, glancing
from one expressive face to the other, she added:
&ldquo;What has happened? You girls look as though
you had a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we have,&rdquo; Nan laughingly replied. &ldquo;I was
just going to tell Muriel a story and if you girls
will come in and be seated, you too, may hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Phyllis, wondering what it all might mean, listened
with increasing interest as Nan told about
the caravan of Queen Mizella and about the loving
kindness of Manna Lou to the little crippled boy,
Tirol, and to the little orphan girl whose mother
had died so long ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that there were such good, unselfish
women among the gypsies,&rdquo; Phyllis declared,
&ldquo;but, Nan, why are you telling us this story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am the orphaned girl,&rdquo; was the quiet
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Phyllis exclaimed. &ldquo;Now I know why
you are so wonderful and why you seem to understand
the songs of the birds and feel such a comradeship
for the trees and sky and all out-of-doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t love me any the less?&rdquo; the
question was asked in half seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan, what do I care who your ancestors are?&rdquo;
Phyllis declared. &ldquo;It is you whom I love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; the gypsy girl said with lifted finger.
&ldquo;The chapel bell is calling us to evening prayer.&rdquo;
And then, as she and Muriel were the last to leave
the room, she kissed the younger girl as she whispered,
&ldquo;Good night, dear little friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">THE CONTEST RECITAL.</span></h2>
<p>The day of the contest dawned gloriously. During
the night pink and golden crocuses had blossomed
on the seminary grounds and each bush and
tree was a haze of silvery green.</p>
<p>In the mid-afternoon two girls stood at an open
library window. They were Muriel and Nan and
they were waiting their turn at the recital. In the
study hall beyond many parents and friends were
gathered and with the teachers and pupils of the
seminary, they were listening with pride and pleasure
to the rendering of solos on violin and piano,
while at one side of the platform, a golden harp
stood waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daisy Wells is playing now,&rdquo; Muriel said, &ldquo;Are
you nervous Nan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No dearie.&rdquo; Then the older girl exclaimed
joyfully, &ldquo;Do look in the lilac bush! The first
robin has come, and now he is going to sing for us.
He surely would win the medal if he were to enter the
contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel looked up at the other maiden and slipping
an arm about her, she said impulsively, &ldquo;I
love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, before the gypsy girl could reply, the
younger harpist was called. &ldquo;Oh Nan,&rdquo; she said in
a sudden panic of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of your father, dearie and just play for
him.&rdquo; How calming that suggestion had been,
and, while she played, Muriel was thinking of the
twilight hours when her father had lifted her to
his knee, and, holding her close, had told her of
that other little girl whom he had so loved, and
how lonely his boyhood had been when that little
sister had died, and, how like her, Muriel was. &ldquo;It
will be a happy day for me, little daughter, when I
hear you play as she did on the harp,&rdquo; he had often
said.</p>
<p>When the last sweet notes were stilled, there were
tears in many eyes, for Muriel, forgetting all others,
had played alone for her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Professor Bentz was amazed and delighted. &ldquo;I
knew she had talent,&rdquo; he said to Mrs. Dorsey, the
principal of the school, &ldquo;but I did not know that
she could play like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the recital was over, it was to Muriel that
the medal of gold was awarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Nan, I ought not to take it. You have done
it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a happy light in the eyes of the gypsy
girl as she stooped and kissed her little friend.
&ldquo;You played wonderfully dearie!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Just at that moment a maid appeared in the library
door, where the performers had gathered.
&ldquo;Miss Muriel,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;there is a gentleman
here to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s father!&rdquo; the little girl cried with eyes aglow.
&ldquo;I do believe that he came for the recital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she was right. Mr. Metcalf was standing in
the small reception room and he caught his little
daughter in his arms and held her close for a moment
without speaking.</p>
<p>He said in a choking voice: &ldquo;My dream is fulfilled.
You play the harp, Muriel, as my sister did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told her that he had long planned to visit
her at the school and had timed that visit so that
he might be present at the recital without her
knowing it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I must have known it, somehow,&rdquo; the
happy little girl said, &ldquo;for I was playing only for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nan Barrington, who had done so much to
help Muriel, felt that the winning of the love of her
little &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; was far more to be desired than the
winning of the medal of gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">A JOYOUS INVITATION.</span></h2>
<p>A month had passed and the orchard back of the
school was a bower of pink and white blooms, while
oriole, robin and meadow lark made the fragrant
sunlit air joyous with song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Gypsy Nan stood at the open window of their
room gazing out over the treetops to the highway,
and how she yearned for her pony Binnie. She
longed to gallop away, away&mdash;where, she cared
little. Then she thought of the happy ride she and
Robert Widdemere had taken three years before,
and, sitting down on the window seat, with her
chin resting on one hand, she fell to musing of
those other days. Again she was a little girl, clad
in a cherry red dress and seated in the boughs of the
far-away pepper tree which stood on the edge of the
Barrington estate in San Seritos. She recalled the
sad, pale invalid boy in the wheeled chair, and she
smiled as she remembered his surprise when a cluster
of pepper berries had dropped on his listlessly
folded hands. What splendid friends those two
became the weeks that followed, and then there had
been that last morning on the mountain top when
he had promised that he would always be her
friend, come what might. Little had they dreamed
that years would pass, and that neither would know
what had become of the other.</p>
<p>How she would like to see Robert Widdemere.
He would be taller and broader, with a dignity of
carriage which he surely would have acquired after
three years&rsquo; training in a military academy. How
good looking he had been that long ago Thanksgiving
morning when he had worn the gypsy costume!</p>
<p>At this point Nan&rsquo;s revery was interrupted by
Phyllis, who fairly danced into the room. She held
an open letter and she gaily exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan darling, you never could guess what you
and I are going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a happy something, by the way you
are shining.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is the most exciting thing that ever happened
in all my life,&rdquo; the other girl exclaimed joyously
as she sat on the window seat facing her
friend. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an invitation that came in this letter,
and Mrs. Dorsey has granted us both permission to
accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s dark eyes were wide with wonder. &ldquo;Am
I invited to go somewhere?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t keep me guessing about it any longer. Do tell
me where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll have to begin at the beginning.
You have often heard me speak of my cousins the
Dorchesters.&rdquo; Nan nodded. &ldquo;They have been in
Florida all winter,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but now they
have returned and have opened up their city home
and the tenth of May will be Peggy&rsquo;s birthday and
we are invited to her party. It will be on Saturday
night, but Mrs. Dorsey said that we need not
return to Pine Crest until the following day&mdash;and
oh, I forgot to tell you! It&rsquo;s a masquerade and we
must begin at once to think what costumes we will
wear. I have the sweetest May Queen dress! I
might wear that with a wreath of apple blossoms in
my hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joy, that would just suit you, but pray what
shall I wear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, do wear your red and gold gypsy
dress. You look just beautiful in that. Say that
you will to please me,&rdquo; Phyllis pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; to please you and also to please myself.
I would just love to have an excuse to wear
that wonderful shawl that once long ago belonged
to my beautiful mother.&rdquo; There was always a
wistful expression in the dark eyes when Nan spoke
of the mother whom she had never known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was your mother&mdash;&rdquo; Phyllis hesitated.</p>
<p>Nan turned clear eyes toward her friend. &ldquo;Was she
a gypsy, do you mean? Dearie, I don&rsquo;t in the least
mind talking about it. Ask me anything that you
wish. The only part that I regret is that I cannot
answer anything with real knowledge. I have always
supposed that my mother was the one of my
parents who was a gypsy. That is what I told
Queen Luella, but afterwards, in thinking it over,
I wondered if it might not have been my father, or
perhaps they both belonged to the band of Queen
Mizella, I was not to be told until I was eighteen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>After a thoughtful moment Phyllis ventured:
&ldquo;Nan, would you feel very badly if you were to
discover that you are not a real gypsy at all; that
perhaps your mother for some reason had given you
into the keeping of Manna Lou and had died before
she returned to claim you? You might have been
a Rumanian princess and the throne might have
been threatened and it was necessary to hide you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s merry laughter pealed out. &ldquo;Phyllis, you
are trying to steal my thunder, making up exciting
tales as you go along. Now you know, dearie,
that I have won fame, if not fortune, by improvising
impossible fiction, and I do not want to relinquish,
even to you, the laurels I have won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis watching the glowing dark face asked
another question. &ldquo;What do the real Rumanians
look like. I mean the ones that are not gypsies.
Aren&rsquo;t they very dark and beautiful just as you
are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan sprang to her feet and made a sweeping
curtsy as she exclaimed dramatically:&mdash;&ldquo;Would
that everyone had eyes like yours. But truly, dear,&rdquo;
the gypsy girl dropped back into her deep easy chair,
&ldquo;I know no more of the Rumanians than you do.
Just what we have learned in our illustrated book
on &lsquo;Men and Manners of Many Lands.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t answered my question,&rdquo; the
fair girl persisted. &ldquo;Would you be dissappointed if
some day it should be discovered that you are white
and&mdash;.&rdquo; Again Nan laughingly interrupted, making
an effort to look in the mirror without rising.
&ldquo;Goodness, am I black?&rdquo; Then, before Phyllis
could remonstrate, Nan continued; &ldquo;I thought I
was just a nice brown or&mdash;&ldquo; Her friend sprang up
and kissed her lovingly, then perched on the arm
of the chair, she exclaimed warmly: &ldquo;You have
the most velvety smooth olive complexion. Many
American girls have one similar, but not nearly as
nice, and now, since you do not want to answer
my question, we will change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan, nestled lovingly against her friend. &ldquo;Indeed
I shall answer your question. I would be very,
very sorry if I were to suddenly learn that I am not
at all a gypsy. I would feel&mdash;well as though I
were a stranger to myself or as though my past was
a dream from which I had been rudely awakened.
I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to begin to live as somebody
quite different.&rdquo; Then, as a bell rang and Phyllis
arose, Nan concluded: &ldquo;But we need have no fear
of such a sudden transforming, for I <i>know</i> I am a
gypsy. Manna Lou never told a lie and she said
time and again that the only part of my story that
she would or could tell me was that I am one of
their own band.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Impulsively Phyllis kissed her friend. &ldquo;If being
a gypsy is what makes you so adorable, I wish we
had more of your band in our midst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then after hastily tidying and washing in their
very own wee lavatory, arm in arm the two girls
went down to the dining hall again, chatting happily
about the week-end treat that was in store for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">NAN&rsquo;S FIRST MASQUERADE.</span></h2>
<p>The home of the Dorchesters was brilliantly
lighted and the little hostess Peggy, who represented
a rose fairy, was exquisitely gowned in filmy
pink. Her small black mask hung over her shoulder
and she was arranging a huge basket of apple
blossom sprays in the library when Phyllis, looking
like a very lovely May Queen, entered the room.</p>
<p>Peggy whirled around and holding out both
hands, she kissed her cousin impulsively as she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad that you could come.
It&rsquo;s just ages since I saw you last, and ever so many
things have happened. Tomorrow morning we&rsquo;ll
have a talkfast and gossip for hours, but do tell me
who is the room-mate that you asked if you might
bring. I just saw her a minute as you came in,
but I thought that she was very beautiful, dark
like a Spanish of French girl, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Then,
without waiting for an answer, impetuous Peggy
hurried on as a new thought presented itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phyllis you never could guess who is coming
tonight. One of our boy cousins whom we haven&rsquo;t
seen in just ever so long, but there, I ought not to
be calling him a boy, he&rsquo;s so big and good-looking?
His mother is staying with us and she talks about
her wonderful son all of the time. She plans to
have him make a most eligible marriage, but he
doesn&rsquo;t seem to care for girls at all. Oh, here comes
your friend! Isn&rsquo;t that gypsy costume fascinating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan Barrington was presented to the little hostess
and to her mother, who appeared at that moment
to assist in receiving, and then the guests began to
arrive.</p>
<p>Phyllis and Nan retreated to a seat beneath a
bank of palms and not far from the hidden musicians.
They had on their masks and Nan, who
had never before attended a real party of any kind,
was interested in all that she saw. Suddenly she
caught her friend&rsquo;s hand as she said softly, &ldquo;Phyllis,
will you look at the young man who is just entering!
Who do you suppose he is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he has on a gypsy costume! That&rsquo;s rather
strange, isn&rsquo;t it? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be amusing, Nan,
if he should ask you to dance? There are to be no
personal introductions, you know. Only close
friends of Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s and Peg&rsquo;s are invited, and
so, of course, that in itself is sufficient introduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Phyllis had been talking a youth dressed
as a knight had approached and asked her to join
the promenade with him, and so, for a moment
Nan was left alone. She did not mind and she sat
smiling as she thought how like a play it all was
when suddenly she heard someone saying, &ldquo;Lady
Gypsy, will you promenade with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan sprang to her feet and held out both hands
impulsively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought of you the
moment that I saw that costume but it isn&rsquo;t the one
that you wore so long ago and I never dreamed
that it could be you, but your voice&mdash;I&rsquo;m not mistaken
in it, am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the lad tore off his mask and looked
down at the girl with an expression of radiant joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Red Bird,&rdquo; the lad exclaimed as he led
her back of the sheltering palms, &ldquo;for three years I
have tried and tried to find you. Did you think
that I had broken the promise that I made to you
high on the mountain? Indeed I have not, and I
never will break it. Please remove your mask. I
want to know what my sister-comrade looks like
after all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert, I wish to speak with you.&rdquo; It was the
voice of his mother calling softly from an open
door near. The lad although deploring the interruption,
was too courteous to not heed his mother&rsquo;s
request. Hurriedly he said: &ldquo;I will be back directly.
I have so much to tell you and so very, very
much that I want to learn about you.&rdquo; He was
leading the gypsy girl back to her seat beneath the
palm.</p>
<p>When he was gone Nan suddenly remembered
that in her surprise and joy at finding her old-time
comrade she had completely forgotten the promise
that she had made his mother three years before on
Thanksgiving day.</p>
<p>Mrs. Widdemere had then forbidden Robert to
ever again speak to the gypsy girl, but before the
indignant lad had time to reply, it was Nan who had
said: &ldquo;You need not be troubled, Mrs. Widdemere,
for I shall never again speak to one of your kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Unconsciously she had broken that promise many
times, for was not her dearly loved room-mate this
woman&rsquo;s niece? Too, even now she had been
speaking to her son. Rising, she decided that she
must go away somewhere and think what would be
the honorable thing for her to do, Just then she
saw Phyllis approaching with her partner and,
hurrying toward them, she said, &ldquo;Phyllis, may I
speak with you alone for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her friend, excusing herself, led the way into a
small reception room and closed the door. &ldquo;What
is it, Nan? You look as though something very
unusual had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gypsy girl&rsquo;s cheeks were burning and it was
plainly evident that she was much excited. &ldquo;Phyllis,&rdquo;
she said hurriedly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me to explain
now. Please help me to get away at once. Can&rsquo;t
I call a taxi and go to Aunt Dahlia? Something
has happened and I will tell you all about it to-morrow.
Don&rsquo;t worry dear, but I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis believing that her dearest friend was
about to be seriously ill, hastened to comply with
her wishes. First she explained this fear to
Peggy&rsquo;s mother, who at once called their chauffeur
and directed him to take Nan to the Barrington
residence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>It was not late and Miss Barrington and her
younger sister. Miss Dahlia, were seated in the
library reading when the girl entered. They were
indeed surprised, for Nan had called on them not
two hours before when she had first arrived in
town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo; Miss Dahlia exclaimed, rising and
going toward the girl with outstretched hands
&ldquo;what is it? Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not ill, but troubled in spirit,&rdquo; Nan said
with a forlorn little laugh. Then she sat on a stool
near the two old ladies and told all that had happened.</p>
<p>Miss Ursula drew herself up proudly as she
said, &ldquo;Sister Dahlia, why did you not tell me this
before? I did not know that Anne had been so
humiliated. I shall certainly inform Mrs. Widdemere
that a girl whom the Barringtons are proud
to adopt as their own is quite worthy to be her
son&rsquo;s companion. Anne, if you wish I will return
with you to the party. Mrs. Dorchester and I were
school-mates long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; Nan replied rather wistfully,
&ldquo;I would rather not go back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Meanwhile Robert, having left his mother, who
merely wished to introduce him to an heiress, returned
to find the seat beneath the palms unoccupied.
Nan was gone and though he stood with
folded arms and watched the passing dancers, he
did not see her. At last he sought the little hostess
and inquired what had become of the guest disguised
as a gypsy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">NAN&rsquo;S DECISION.</span></h2>
<p>Miss Barrington, who had learned to love Nan
as dearly as had her sister, Miss Dahlia, looked admiringly
at the beautiful girl, who, having removed
her gypsy costume, was clad in a clinging simple
white voile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you play for us? The
piano has not been touched in many a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Nan, always glad to please these two,
played and sang the selections chosen by the elderly
ladies.</p>
<p>Suddenly the telephone rang and a maid appeared.
&ldquo;Miss Barrington,&rdquo; she said. Nan ceased
playing, and, to her surprise, she heard Miss
Ursula replying to someone over the wire, &ldquo;Yes
indeed, you may come. We shall be glad to have
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>For some unaccountable reason Nan&rsquo;s heart began
to beat rapidly. Could it be Robert who was
coming? She wondered as she resumed her playing,
but her fingers went at random and then, before
it seemed possible, the door bell rang and a
moment later Robert in his military uniform, entered
the room.</p>
<p>He was gladly welcomed by the two old ladies
who had known him since he wore knickerbockers
and then when Nan went forward and held out her
hand as she said in her frank friendly way, &ldquo;Robert,
forgive me for disappearing, but I suddenly
remembered that I had promised your mother that
I would never again speak to one of her kind, and
I do sincerely wish to keep my promises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Barrington,&rdquo; the lad appealed to the
elderly woman, &ldquo;should one keep a hastily made
promise when there is no justice in it? I am sure
that my father would approve of my friendship
with Nan, and though I regret my mother&rsquo;s attitude,
I do not think that I should be influenced by
it. If you and Miss Dahlia will grant me permission
to be Nan&rsquo;s comrade once more, I will promise
to care for her as I would wish another to care
for a sister of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were seated about the wide hearth for the
evenings were cool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Robert Widdemere,&rdquo; Miss Ursula said, &ldquo;if
Anne wishes your friendship, we will welcome you
into our home whenever you desire to come. We
wish Anne to remain at the Pine Crest seminary
until June. We are then going to our cottage on
the coast of Maine until October, when we will return
to San Seritos for the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad&rsquo;s eyes were glowing. &ldquo;How I would
like to go back there,&rdquo; he said, then, turning to the
girl, he added, laughingly, &ldquo;I suppose Lady Red
Bird is too grown now to climb the pepper tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Nan replied merrily. &ldquo;That is
one of the penalties of being civilized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the lad rose reluctantly. &ldquo;I promised Cousin
Peggy that I would return for the supper dance
at ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and to keep that promise
I must leave at once. But, Nan, you have not yet
told me that you care to have my friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked thoughtfully into the fire a
moment and then replied slowly, &ldquo;Robert Widdemere,
I do want your friendship, but I would be
happier if I might have it with your mother&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall,&rdquo; the boy replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>In the meanwhile Peggy had sought Phyllis. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t in the least understand what is happening,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;First your friend, disguised as a gypsy,
leaves in a panic, then Cousin Robert insists on
knowing where she has gone and follows her, and
when his mother heard about it, she became so angry
that she went at once to her room and bade us
tell Robert to come to her the moment he returns.
What can it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as much a mystery to me, Peg,&rdquo; Phyllis
said. &ldquo;But there comes Robert now. Perhaps
he will explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The interview that Robert Widdemere had with
his mother on his return from the Barrington home
was not a pleasant one for either of them but in the
end Robert had said firmly but gently, &ldquo;I feel sure
that my father would approve of my friendship
with Nan and, moreover, next summer I will be 21
and I shall consider myself old enough then to choose
my own companions. My dad must have expected
me to possess good judgment in some degree or his
request would not have been that I assume the
reins of his business on my 21st birthday.&rdquo; Then,
going to the indignant woman, he put his arm about
her as he said lovingly, &ldquo;Mother, dear, I want you
to tell me that you are willing that I may be Nan
Barrington&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great disappointment,&rdquo; Mrs. Widdemere
said, &ldquo;but, since you are soon to be financially independent
of me, I suppose that I might as well give
my consent. However, do not expect me to receive
that gypsy girl into my home as an equal, for
I shall not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The next morning Phyllis and her cousin Robert
visited the Barrington home and an hour later the
lad accompanied the girls to the station where they
were to take the train for Pine Crest.</p>
<p>Robert had told Nan that he had won his mother&rsquo;s
consent to their friendship but he did not tell how
reluctantly that consent had been given.</p>
<p>The next day the lad returned to the Military
Academy where in another month he would complete
his training, but each week he and Nan exchanged
letters telling of the simple though pleasant experiences
of their school life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Nan and Phyllis were to graduate in June and
they were happily busy from dawn till dark. It had
been the custom for many years at the Pine Crest
Seminary for the pupils to make their own graduating
dresses by hand. These were to be of dainty
white organdie and the two girls, with their classmates,
spent many pleasant hours sewing in one
room and another. Tongues flew as fast as the
needles while each young seamstress told what she
hoped the summer and even the future would hold
for her.</p>
<p>Nan was often thoughtfully silent these last days
of school.</p>
<p>One twilight Phyllis found her standing alone
at their open window watching the early stars come
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking, dear?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering about my own mother,&rdquo; Nan
replied. &ldquo;Next week I will be eighteen and then it
was that Manna Lou planned telling me who I
am, I never could understand why she did not tell
me before, but she said that she had promised, and
now, that I might know, I am too far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your mother was a sister of Manna
Lou,&rdquo; her friend suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but come dear,&rdquo; Nan added in a brighter
tone, &ldquo;we are due even now at French Conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Nan did not speak again of the mystery of her
birth, but she often wondered about it as her eighteenth
birthday neared and she longed to know
more of her own mother, who must have loved her
so dearly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">NAN&rsquo;S EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY.</span></h2>
<p>Nan Barrington&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday dawned
gloriously and as soon as they were dressed Phyllis
disappeared to return a moment later with an armful
of wonderful red roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a happy birthday greeting from a cousin of
mine,&rdquo; she laughingly told the surprised girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are they from Peggy Dorchester?&rdquo; Nan
exclaimed as she took them.</p>
<p>Her friend&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said
&ldquo;this cousin&rsquo;s name is not Peg. Guess again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s dark eyes were glowing above the beautiful
bouquet. &ldquo;Oh, then they are from Robert. How
kind of him to remember my birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lovingly she arranged the fragrant roses in a
large green jar and, selecting a bud, she placed it
in her friend&rsquo;s belt and fastened another at her own.
Then slipping her arm about Phyllis and chatting
happily, they went down the broad front stairway
to the refectory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>When they were returning, half an hour later,
Mrs. Dorsey was in the corridor and she smiled
lovingly in response to the girls&rsquo; morning greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is your eighteenth birthday,
is it not? Can you spare a few moments for a
visit with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Oh yes, indeed, Mrs.
Dorsey,&rdquo; she replied. Phyllis went on to the library
and the gypsy girl entered the office with the
kindly principal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Dorsey said. &ldquo;I have
long planned having this visit with you and now
that you are soon to leave us, I must no longer delay.
Miss Dahlia Barrington, who, as you know,
was a schoolmate of mine, told me how you chanced
to come into their lives. Miss Dahlia is very proud
of you and Miss Ursula is also. I, too, am proud
of your splendid accomplishments, Anne. I feel
that you have made much progress in the three
years that you have been with us and I deeply regret
that you are about to graduate. I know nothing of
your plans for the future but, if the time ever
comes when you wish to be self-supporting, I will
be glad to give you a position as a teacher of languages
and music for the younger pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Dorsey!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed gratefully,
&ldquo;how very kind of you to make me such an offer.
If Miss Dahlia will permit me to do so, I will
gladly start teaching the little ones at the beginning
of the fall term. I have hoped that I might find
some way to repay my benefactors, for, of course, I
have been a great expense to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dorsey smiled and, as she stood, Nan also
arose. &ldquo;I shall indeed be glad to have you with us,
Anne,&rdquo; the kind woman said as she kissed the girl
on each cheek, then she added brightly. &ldquo;Happy
birthday, dear, and may each coming year find you
as unspoiled and lovable as you are today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan flushed happily at this praise and then she
sought Phyllis to tell her the wonderful news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, a teacher!&rdquo; her friend cried in dismay.
&ldquo;Oh Nan, I did so want you to go to college with me
next year. Your aunts are very rich, I am sure,
and I just know that they will not think of permitting
you to earn your own living.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Nan stood looking thoughtfully out of the open
library window. &ldquo;I would rather be independent,&rdquo;
she declared. Then, noting her friend&rsquo;s dismal expression,
she laughingly caught her hands as she
said, &ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t decide the matter, now. I&rsquo;ll
talk it over with Aunt Dahlia when she comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls spent a happy morning together
and in the afternoon Nan said, &ldquo;I wonder why
Aunt Dahlia and Aunt Ursula do not come. They
wrote that they would be here early and take us
both for a long drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another half hour passed and then there was a
knock at the door.</p>
<p>Nan sprang up joyously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Marie to tell me
that my dear aunts have arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed Marie, who held out a yellow envelope
as she said, &ldquo;This telegram just came, Miss
Anne. Mrs. Dorsey isn&rsquo;t in, so I thought I&rsquo;d better
bring it right up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the door had again closed, Nan turned toward
her friend with startled eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Phyllis,&rdquo; she said fearfully, &ldquo;do you suppose
that Aunt Dahlia is ill?&rdquo; Then, tearing open
the yellow envelope, the two girls read the few
words that the message contained. &ldquo;Miss Ursula
Barrington died last night. Miss Dahlia wishes
you to come at once.&rdquo; The signature was that of
a stranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Ursula dead!&rdquo; Nan repeated in dazed uncomprehension.
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be. It must be a mistake,
for only day before yesterday I received a long
letter from her and she wrote that she was feeling
unusually well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that it cannot be a mistake,&rdquo; her friend
said tenderly, &ldquo;but you must be brave and strong,
Nan, for your Aunt Dahlia will need you to comfort
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Phyllis, I will go to her at once.
Have I time to get the three o&rsquo;clock train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, dear. You pack what we will need
in your satchel and I will go and ask Patrick to
bring around the school bus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Phyllis, are you going with me? Mrs.
Dorsey is not here to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Mrs. Dorsey would wish me to go with
you. I would not think of permitting you to go
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few hours later these two girls entered the
city home of the Barringtons. The lower hall
seemed strangely silent, and at once they ascended
the stairway to Miss Dahlia&rsquo;s room. They found
her sitting there alone and when they entered she
hurried toward the girl whom she so loved. &ldquo;Oh
Nan darling,&rdquo; she said with tears rolling down her
wrinkled cheeks. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it. I can&rsquo;t believe
that it has really happened. It was all so sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>The young girl held the feebled old lady in a
close embrace, then leading her to a wide lounge,
she sat beside her, taking the frail hands in her
strong ones. &ldquo;Dear Aunt Dahlia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tell
me what has happened. Has Aunt Ursula been ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all. Yesterday morning a business-like
looking envelope was in the mail for her. She
took it at once to her study and remained there until
noon, continually writing, and when at last she came
to lunch, she looked worn and haggard, but when I
asked her if she felt ill, she said no, and then she
did something very unusual for her. She kissed
me, saying in an almost pitying tone, &lsquo;Poor little sister
Dahlia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directly after lunch she returned to her study
and continued writing. In the afternoon she sent
Dorcas to the postbox with several letters. Last
night we sat by the fireplace reading when suddenly
her book slipped to the floor. I looked up and
saw that she seemed to be asleep. This was so
very unusual that I tried to waken her, but could
not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor whom I had Dorcas summon, said
that my sister must have had some great and sudden
shock. What it could have been, I do not
know. I searched in her desk for that business-like
envelope, but it was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then leaning against the girl, she added, &ldquo;Oh,
Nan darling, how thankful I am that you came to
us so long ago. If I did not have you, I would
now be all alone in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl kissed the little old lady tenderly as she
said, &ldquo;Dear Aunt Dahlia, I, too, am thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Nan went to her own room
and on her desk she saw a large envelope addressed,
&ldquo;To my beloved niece, Anne Barrington.&rdquo; The
writing was Miss Ursula&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">NAN&rsquo;S SUDDEN RESPONSIBILITY.</span></h2>
<p>With a rapidly-beating heart Nan sat at her
desk and opened the large envelope in which there
was a letter and another envelope that was evidently
the one to which Miss Dahlia had referred as
businesslike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Anne,&rdquo; the girl read, &ldquo;I am prostrated
with grief today and you will not wonder when I
tell you that I was wrongly advised by one whom I
considered a trustworthy friend, and I invested, not
only my own fortune but also Sister Dahlia&rsquo;s in
securities that I am now informed are absolutely
worthless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did this, I assure you, with my sister&rsquo;s permission,
for, as you know, she had great faith in my
business ability and good judgment. The result is
that we are suddenly reduced to straitened circumstances
which will necessitate an entire change in
our mode of living.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am indeed glad that our Anne has been able
to complete the course of studies at Pine Crest Seminary
before this calamity befell us. There is one
other thing which in this hour of humiliation and
grief is a consolation to me, and that is that our
home in San Seritos is in no way effected. It is in
my sister&rsquo;s name and cannot be taken from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A blot followed and then with an evidently shaking
hand had been written: &ldquo;Anne, a sharp pain
in my heart warns me that I must cease writing for
awhile and rest. I had intended mailing this letter
to you, but, remembering that it would reach you
on your eighteenth birthday and shadow the happiness
which is rightfully yours at that time, I have
decided to place it on your desk and when you
come on Sunday, you and I will retire to your room
and discuss the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you know, my dear Anne, it is difficult for
me to express in words the emotions that I may
feel, but I want you to know how proud I am of the
little girl who came to us three years ago. You have
brought a new happiness into my life and I must confess,
that, though my original thought was merely
to Christianize one whom I called a heathen, I myself
have become more sympathetic and loving,
more truly a Christian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Anne. If I should be taken away
before my dear sister Dahlia, I will go with far
greater willingness knowing that you will care for
her and comfort her as long as she shall live.</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Your loving,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Aunt Ursula</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The postscript had evidently been written much
later. The writing was easily legible. &ldquo;Anne, another
of those sharp heart attacks warns me that I
would better place in your care the money that we
have on hand. I sent Dorcas to the bank this afternoon
to draw it out and I have locked it in my
desk; the key I am enclosing. There will be sufficient
to care for you and sister Dahlia for at least
a year; after that I am sure that my brave Anne
will find a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Phyllis quietly entered the room a few moments
later and saw Nan seated at her desk, her head on
her arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phyllis,&rdquo; she sobbed, as her friend sat beside
her and tried to comfort her, &ldquo;how Aunt Ursula
must have suffered. If only I had been here. Perhaps
if we had talked it over together, it might
have been a help to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan then gave the letter to Phyllis to read, and
after a thoughtful moment, added, &ldquo;I must be
worthy of the trust that splendid woman has placed
in me. How glad I am that I will be able to teach.
I shall not tell Aunt Dahlia of the financial loss
until it is necessary. She is very frail and it might
be more than she could stand. Come dear, let us
go to her. I do not want to leave her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week later Nan returned to Pine Crest Seminary
and Miss Dahlia was with her. Mrs. Dorsey
had at once visited the Barrington home and had
insisted that her old friend share her pleasant apartment
at the school until Nan had successfully passed
the final examinations and had received her diploma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE VALEDICTORIAN.</span></h2>
<p>A few days before the closing exercises at Pine
Crest Seminary, Phyllis entered their room and exclaimed
jubilantly to the girl who was seated at
the writing desk. &ldquo;Nan Barrington, you never can
guess who passed with the highest marks and is to
be chosen class valedictorian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl looked up brightly. &ldquo;It was
Phyllis Dorchester, I do believe,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. That guess is far afield. The successful
maiden is Anne Barrington. There, now,
what do you think of that? Mrs. Dorsey just told
me and I simply couldn&rsquo;t walk upstairs demurely,
I was so eager to tell you. How proud I will be at
the closing exercises to see my room-mate standing
before a crowded assembly room reading her graduating
essay on &lsquo;Comrading With Nature.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s
poetry in prose, Nan, and I am glad that you are to
read it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I will not be here for the closing exercises,
and so if that essay is read, you will have to do it
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan Barrington! Not be here, and the closing
exercises less than a week away! Why, where are
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and I will tell you. I would love to
stay, as you well know, if I had only my own wishes
to consider, but each day Aunt Dahlia seems to
grow more frail. Naturally Mrs. Dorsey and I
have been much occupied and Aunt Dahlia has
often been left alone with her sorrow in a strange
apartment. Each time that I go to her, she clings
to me as a frightened child would, and over and
over again she tells me that she knows she will be
strong again as soon as we are back in the gardens
at San Seritos, then she always ends by asking in a
pathetic tone, &lsquo;Nan, do you think that we will be
able to go tomorrow?&rsquo; and today my answer was
&lsquo;yes, Aunt Dahlia, we will go tomorrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis reached for her friend&rsquo;s hand and held it
in a sympathetic clasp and tears sprang to her eyes.
She knew what a sacrifice Nan was making, for
they had often talked of the happy time they would
have at their graduation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How disappointed Robert will be,&rdquo; Phyllis said
at last, &ldquo;but, dear, of course it is right that you
should go. How I do wish that I might go with
you, but Mother and Dad and I are leaving for England
in another month. However, if you remain
in California, do not be surprised next winter to
see me appearing, bag and baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan smiled lovingly at her friend. &ldquo;No one could
be more welcome,&rdquo; she said, then she added thoughtfully,
&ldquo;I have indeed a difficult problem to solve
for I want to live as economically as we possibly
can and yet not disclose to poor Aunt Dahlia the
truth concerning the lost fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis sprang to her feet and kissed her friend
on the forehead, as she exclaimed, &ldquo;And you will be
able to do it, Nan darling, I&rsquo;m sure of that! Now
I must depart, and you must finish that letter if it
is to go on the next mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Nan was alone, she continued writing until
several sheets of note paper had been covered.
She was telling her comrade all that had happened
and explaining why she would not be able to attend
her own graduating party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Two days later the letter reached Robert Widdemere,
and, after reading it, he sat for a long time
gazing thoughtfully into space. In another month
he would be of age and master of his own actions
and possessed of a goodly income. He sprang to
his feet at the call of a bugle summoning him to
drill, but in his heart there was a firm resolve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><span class="small">FAITHFUL FRIENDS.</span></h2>
<p>A week had passed and it was nearing the end
of June when Miss Dahlia and Nan arrived at the
little station of San Seritos. They found Mr.
Sperry, the gardener, waiting to take them home
in the Barrington car, which had the family coat of
arms emblazoned on the door.</p>
<p>Nan had written a long letter to this faithful
servant and his kindly wife, telling of Miss Ursula&rsquo;s
death and also informing them that Miss Dahlia
had but little money left, and, would be obliged to
dispense with the services of so expert a gardener
as Mr. Sperry. Nan had then added that since
Miss Dahlia was very frail, she thought best
not to tell her of the changed financial conditions,
but if Mr. Sperry would accept a position
elsewhere, Miss Dahlia would suppose that to be
the reason he was leaving her service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>When Mr. Sperry read this letter to his wife, he
removed his spectacles and wiped them as he said,
&ldquo;Nell, Miss Dahlia is one of God&rsquo;s good women if
there ever was one. Mind you the time little Bobsy
had diphtheria and you couldn&rsquo;t get a nurse? You&rsquo;d
have died yourself with the care of it all if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for that blessed woman coming right down
here and staying quarantined in this lodge house
where there weren&rsquo;t any comforts such as she had
been used to, and now, that she&rsquo;s in trouble, it isn&rsquo;t
likely we&rsquo;re going to desert her. No, sir, not us!
The Baxters have been at me this month past to
work on their place half time, and I&rsquo;ll do it. Then
we can raise our own vegetables and plenty for
Miss Dahlia besides, in the kitchen garden here
and she&rsquo;ll never know but what Miss Nan is paying
us a salary regular, just as we always had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Samuel,&rdquo; Mrs. Sperry said wiping
her eyes with the corner of her blue apron.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the sort to be forgetting past kindness.
I&rsquo;ll go up to the big house this minute with Bertha
and we&rsquo;ll air it out and have Miss Dahlia&rsquo;s room
cheerful and waiting for her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>And so when Mr. Sperry saw Nan assisting Miss
Barrington to the platform, he hurried forward,
and, snatching off his cap, he took the hand the
little lady held out to him. It was hard for him to
steady his voice as he said, &ldquo;Miss Dahlia, it&rsquo;s good
to see your kind face again. It&rsquo;s been lonesome
having the big house closed for so long and it&rsquo;s glad
I am to have it opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears rolled down the wrinkled cheeks of the
little old lady. This home-coming was hard, for,
during the last two years Miss Ursula had been
much changed, more of a loving sister and a comrade.</p>
<p>When they reached the house, Mrs. Sperry was
on the veranda and Bertha, now a tall girl of eleven,
was standing shyly at her mother&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The doors were wide open, and Nan, glancing
in, saw that there were bowls of ferns and flowers
in the hall and library. As she greeted Mrs. Sperry,
she said softly, &ldquo;It was very kind of you to do all
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl assisted Miss Dahlia up the wide
front stairs. The gardener&rsquo;s wife called after them
&ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve laid off your wraps come down to the
dining room. It&rsquo;s nearly noon and I thought you
might be hungry after traveling so far.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Sperry, we will,&rdquo; Nan replied,
and tears sprang to her eyes as she thought how
loyal these kind people were and with no hope of
remuneration.</p>
<p>Later, while they were eating the appetizing
luncheon which the gardener&rsquo;s wife was serving,
Miss Dahlia asked, &ldquo;Mrs. Sperry, will you see
about hiring maids and a cook for us as soon as
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman glanced at Nan questioningly and
that girl hurried to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Dahlia dear, please don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have
any just yet. I do want to learn to keep house
and the best way to learn, you know, is really
to do it. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Mrs. Sperry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, Miss Nan,&rdquo; that little woman replied
with enthusiasm, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be right handy by,
whenever you need help extra, for cleaning days
and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia smiled. &ldquo;Well dearie,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;you may try for a week or so, but at the end of
that time, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that you will be glad to
hire a cook and at least one maid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>The next morning, when Miss Dahlia awakened,
it was to see a smiling lassie in a pretty ruffled white
apron approaching her bedside with a tray on which
was a cup of steaming coffee and a covered plate
of delicately browned toast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the morning to you, Aunt Dahlia,&rdquo; the
girl laughingly called as she brought a wash cloth
and towel and then a dainty lavender dressing jacket
and cap. A few minutes later when the pleased
little old lady was sitting up among comfortably
placed pillows, Nan with arms akimbo, inquired,
&ldquo;Is there anything more ye&rsquo;ll be afther wantin&rsquo; this
mornin&rsquo;, Miss Barrington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan darling,&rdquo; the little woman replied
brightly, &ldquo;I truly did think that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able
to get on without Norah, but I believe that after all
my new maid is going to prove a much handier
young person. Have you breakfasted, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I have, Aunt Dahlia, and my head is as
full of delightful plans as a Christmas pudding is of
plums, but first I wish to ask if I may have your
permission to play the game just as I wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you have it without the asking. Get all
the amusement that you can get of the experiment,
but, Nan dearie, don&rsquo;t you think that you would better
reconsider and have at least one house maid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>The girl shook her head and her dark eyes
danced merrily as she again returned to Norah&rsquo;s
brogue. &ldquo;And is it discharging me, ye are, on the
very fust day of me service wid ye? Arrah, and
oi&rsquo;ll not be goin&rsquo; till ye&rsquo;ve given me a fair two weeks&rsquo;
triol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia smiled happily. What a comfort
this gypsy girl was to her. Then suddenly the little
woman realized that she had not thought of Nan as
a gypsy for a long time. It did not seem possible
that this loving and lovable girl could be the same
little wild waif who had climbed out of an upper
window nearly four years ago because she did not
want to be civilized.</p>
<p>When the tray was ready to be carried away, the
audacious maid stooped and kissed the smiling face
of the little old lady as she inquired, &ldquo;Will ye dress
now, or will ye be staying&rsquo; in bed for the mornin&rsquo;,
Miss Dahlia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to remain in bed, dearie, if you are sure
that you don&rsquo;t need me to help you around the house.
It was a long journey across the continent and now
that we are <i>really</i> home it seems so nice to just rest
and look out of the window at the garden and the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed as she drew
the downy quilt over the frail shoulders. &ldquo;Perhaps
you&rsquo;ll return to dreamland awhile. Now, don&rsquo;t
forget that you have granted me permission to carry
out my plans in my own sweet way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Nan was gone, the little old lady, resting
luxuriously, wondered what her dear child might
be planning, and then, truly weary, she again fell
into a refreshing slumber.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nan had donned her riding habit and,
having visited the barn, she found her Binnie in
fine trim. The small horse whinnied joyfully
when he beheld his mistress, and Nan, putting her
arms about him, caressed him lovingly. Two years
before she had written Mrs. Sperry, telling her to
permit the children to ride Binnie, and so the small
horse had had many a merry canter and had not
been lonely.</p>
<p>Saddling and mounting her mottled pony, Nan
rode down the circling drive to the lodge house.
She was about to carry out a plan, which was merely
another way to economize and not let Miss Dahlia
recognize it as such.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><span class="small">NAN AS HOUSEKEEPER.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mrs. Sperry,&rdquo; Nan called as
she drew rein at the door of the lodge.
&ldquo;Could Bertha go up to the house and stay until I
have cantered into town and back? Miss Dahlia is
still in bed and I have a few purchases to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Nan told her new plan and the gardener&rsquo;s
wife replied, &ldquo;Bertha and Bobsy are in school. They
take their lunch and stay all day and my husband
works over at Baxters&rsquo; now till mid-afternoon, so
I&rsquo;ll take my basket of darning and go right up to
be near Miss Dahlia if she should call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Sperry, I won&rsquo;t be gone long
and you&rsquo;ll find my room just flooded with sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later Nan returned and soon thereafter
a delivery wagon left a bundle at the kitchen door.
Mrs. Sperry declared that she could stay all the
morning just as well as not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Miss Dahlia did not awaken. Now and then Mrs.
Sperry heard the tapping of a hammer from the
ground floor where the kitchen and maid&rsquo;s dining
room were and she wondered what Miss Dahlia
would think of the new plan.</p>
<p>At about noon, Nan tiptoed upstairs and the gardener&rsquo;s
wife looked up with a welcoming smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the last hole in the last stocking,&rdquo; she said
softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to have them all done.&rdquo; Then
she added, &ldquo;Is the new plan finished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. &ldquo;I do hope Aunt Dahlia will
like it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan, dearie,&rdquo; a sweet voice called from the next
room, and Mrs. Sperry taking her basket of darned
stockings, nodded goodbye and tiptoed away while
the girl went to answer the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had such a restful sleep, dear,&rdquo; the little
old lady said, &ldquo;and now I&rsquo;ll dress and help you prepare
our lunch. Really, Nan, I shall enjoy being
allowed to go into a kitchen again. You know
when I was a girl it was considered both proper
and fashionable for a young lady to learn how to
cook that she might direct her servants intelligently,
if for no other reason, and many times I&rsquo;ve wished
I might slip down, when the cook was away, and
see if I could still make some of the things as my
dear mother taught me, but Sister Ursula did not
approve. She said one of the maids might see me
and think that I was queer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Nan laughed. &ldquo;What fun we will have, Aunt
Dahlia,&rdquo; she declared as she assisted the little old
lady to dress, &ldquo;for, if you will, I would like to have
you teach me to cook as your mother taught you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when they were ready to go down stairs,
Miss Dahlia said with almost girlish eagerness,
&ldquo;This afternoon we&rsquo;ll go up in the attic. There&rsquo;s
a box somewhere up there which is filled with
books, and in one of them my mother kept her
tried recipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan led the way past the cold, formal dining
room, with its polished table and high-backed carved
chairs. The little old lay shuddered as she glanced
in. &ldquo;It will be hard to get used to having Sister
Ursula&rsquo;s place always vacant,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it would, dear Aunt Dahlia,&rdquo; the girl
replied, as she put an arm about the little lady, &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s why I have planned to have our dining room
somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>They had reached the ground floor and the girl
opened a door. Miss Dahlia glanced in and then
she exclaimed with real pleasure, &ldquo;Nan, how
charmingly you have arranged this little room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had formerly been the maids&rsquo; dining room.
It was on a level with the ground. The wide windows
opened upon the garden, a lilac bush, close
to the house was fragrant with bloom, and a mocking
bird, somewhere near, was singing joyously.
But it was the inside which had been transformed
as though by magic. Nan had scrubbed the creamy
walls and woodwork and had hung blue and white
draperies at the sunny windows, while at one side
stood a high long basket-box of drooping ferns. The
table was daintily set with blue bird dishes which
Nan had used in boarding school when she had a
spread for her friends. There were only two chairs,
and, since Miss Ursula had never dined in this room,
the loneliness of one gone could not be so keenly
felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, my lady,&rdquo; the merry girl said as she
drew out the chair that faced the garden. &ldquo;You
are now to partake of the very first meal that your
new cook has ever prepared.&rdquo; Miss Dahlia was
delighted with the dainty luncheon. Nan chatted
joyously, although whenever she was alone, she
pondered deeply on how to solve the serious problem
that was confronting them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI.
<br /><span class="small">NAN&rsquo;S PROBLEM.</span></h2>
<p>That morning when Nan had been in the village
of San Seritos, she deposited in the bank the money
which Miss Ursula had left in her keeping. The
interest from the few thousand dollars would be
sufficient, the girl thought, to provide comforts
and even some luxuries for Miss Dahlia, but the
necessities Nan wished to earn, knowing that if
they used the principal, it would soon be necessary
to tell Miss Dahlia of the lost fortune, and the home
which the little old lady so dearly loved, would
have to be sold.</p>
<p>Before leaving Pine Crest Nan had talked the
matter over with Mrs. Dorsey and that kindly
woman had written a letter telling whoever might
be interested that in her opinion Nan Barrington
was competent to teach the younger children all
of the required studies, as well as languages and
the harp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>The girl was confident that she could obtain a
position as governess but that would necessitate
hiring a maid or leaving Miss Dahlia alone, and
neither of these things did she wish to do.</p>
<p>A week had passed when one morning Nan sitting
on the sunny veranda reading the paper chanced
to see in the want column something which she
thought that she would like to investigate.</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia was still asleep and Mrs. Sperry
gladly took her sewing up to the big house while Nan
rode away on Binnie.</p>
<p>She had not far to go, for a quarter of a mile
down the coast highway was a group of picturesque
bungalows about a small hotel called Miracielo.
Here each summer wealthy folk from the inland
country came and took up their abode. This year
it chanced that there were many young children
among the tourists, and Mrs. Welton, manager of
the exclusive hotel, had advertised for someone
who would both instruct and entertain the little
guests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Nan was admitted to Mrs. Welton&rsquo;s reception
room and almost immediately a pleasant woman of
refinement appeared and graciously welcomed the
visitor. Nan explained her mission and showed the
letter from Mrs. Dorsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is indeed interesting,&rdquo; Mrs. Welton exclaimed.
&ldquo;My niece, Daisy Wells, attends that school
and in her letters she has often mentioned Nan
Barrington.&rdquo; Then the kindly woman hesitated as
though not quite certain that she ought to voice the
thought that had come to her. Finally she said:
&ldquo;You will pardon me, I know, for mentioning a
matter so personal, but I have always understood
that your aunt possessed great wealth. Will she
be willing that you entertain these little ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, decided to tell
Mrs. Welton the whole truth and that good woman
was much impressed in favor of the girl who was
trying in every way to keep the frail Miss Dahlia
Barrington from a knowledge of the loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not be possible for me to come each
day to Miracielo,&rdquo; Nan said, &ldquo;but we have such a
delightful rustic house in our garden; do you suppose,
Mrs. Welton, that the children might come
there each afternoon if I can persuade Aunt Dahlia
to think favorably of my plan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do indeed,&rdquo; the pleased woman smilingly
agreed. &ldquo;That is the time when many of my guests
desire to rest, and they would be glad to have the
children away. If their mothers consent, I can
send the little ones to you in our car every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan arose, her dark eyes glowing. &ldquo;I thank you
Mrs. Welton,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and tomorrow I will let
you know if I have won my aunt&rsquo;s consent to the
plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That afternoon the gypsy girl broached the subject
of the little class almost timidly, and her aunt
said lovingly, &ldquo;But, Nan, darling, don&rsquo;t you realize
that all I have is also yours? You do not need to
earn money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Aunt Dahlia,&rdquo; the girl replied with sudden
tears in her eyes, &ldquo;I well know that whatever you
have, you wish to share with me, but truly I would
just love to try teaching for a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Nan seems to wish to make many experiments,&rdquo;
the little old lady said merrily. &ldquo;Is not
housekeeping enough?&rdquo; Then, noting an expression
of disappointment in the face of the girl, she
added, &ldquo;Bring your flock of children to our garden,
if you wish dearie, I, too, will enjoy having them
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>And so, the very next afternoon a dozen boys and
girls, the oldest not seven, appeared, and though,
for a time, some of them seemed shy, Nan soon won
their confidence and had them merrily romping on
a velvety stretch of lawn which she had chosen for
a playground. Then when they were weary, they
went into the vine-covered rustic house, and, sitting
about the long table, they played quiet games
that were both instructive and amusing.</p>
<p>After receiving her first week&rsquo;s check, Nan visited
the town and purchased books and materials
that would assist her in teaching and entertaining
her little &ldquo;guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy times Miss Dahlia and Nan had in the
long evenings as they sat in the cheerfully lighted
library reading these books, and then they would try
to weave a pattern from gaily colored wools or
bright strips of paper according to the instructions.
The next day that particular pattern would be the
one that Nan would show the children how to make.</p>
<p>One afternoon Miss Dahlia wandered out to the
rustic house during this rest period, and, sitting at
one end of the table she assisted a darling five-year-old
to make a paper mat of glowing colors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Miss Nan,&rdquo; the little fairy called joyously
when the task was done, &ldquo;see my pitty mat! May
I take it home to show muvver?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed, dearies, you may all take home
whatever you make,&rdquo; their young teacher told
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could make doggies or elphunts,&rdquo;
one small boy said. And that night Miss Dahlia and
Nan hunted through the books for instructions on
&ldquo;elphunt&rdquo; making, but failed to find them. Then
Nan, not wishing to disappoint the little lad, brought
forth scissors and cardboard and after many amusing
failures, at last cut out a figure which Miss
Dahlia laughingly assured the artist could be recognized
as an &ldquo;elphunt&rdquo; at a single glance. They
then cut out a dozen that the children might each
have a pattern.</p>
<p>The little boy was delighted because his suggestion
had been followed. Nan showed them how
to make their card-board animals stand, and soon
they had a long procession of rather queerly shaped
&ldquo;elphunts&rdquo; and dogs all the way down the length
of the table. The pleased children clapped their
hands gleefully, and one little girl looked up with
laughing eyes as she said: &ldquo;Miss Nan, it&rsquo;s as nice
as a party every day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Sometimes the older girl, watching these children
of the rich as they romped about on the velvety
lawn, recalled another picture of the long ago. A
group of dark-haired, dark-skinned, fox-like little
creatures scrambling and rolling over each other
as puppies do, but, when Nan had appeared, they
had left their play and raced to meet her with outstretched
arms.</p>
<p>How she would like to see them all again. Nan&rsquo;s
life was happy but uneventful. The beautiful sunny,
summery days passed and Nan&rsquo;s little class never
wearied of the &ldquo;Party-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all at once unexpected and surprising,
events followed close, one after another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<h2 id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><span class="small">SURPRISING THINGS HAPPEN.</span></h2>
<p>It was Autumn once more. The children with
their parents had returned to inland homes and the
garden no longer echoed with their shouts and
laughter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Welton had told Nan that the winter tourists
from the snowy East would arrive in January
and that she would re-engage her at that time if
she cared to continue her little class, which the eager
girl gladly consented to do. The remuneration had
been excellent, and, during the intervening months,
Nan planned keeping happily busy with sewing and
home-making.</p>
<p>The garden was again glowing with yellow chrysanthemums
as it had been on that long ago day
when the gypsy girl and the little lad Tirol had first
found the beach gate and the home which Nan had
little dreamed was to be her own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>During the summer there had been many letters
from Phyllis who was traveling abroad and from
Robert Widdemere. Upon leaving the military
academy, the lad&rsquo;s first desire had been to cross the
continent at once, but, when he found many tasks
waiting in his father&rsquo;s office, he believed that he
ought not to start on a pleasure trip until these had
been in some measure accomplished and it was
November before he decided that he could start on
the long planned journey. When he told his mother
of his decision, she announced that she intended accompanying
him and remaining during the winter
at their San Seritos home.</p>
<p>This was a keen disappointment to the lad, who
believed that his mother merely wished to try to
prevent, if she could, his friendship with Nan Barrington,
but Robert was too fine a lad to be discourteous,
and so, on a blustery day, they left the
East, and, in less than a week, they arrived in the
garden village of San Seritos that was basking in
the sunshine under a blue cloudless sky.</p>
<p>An hour later, Robert leaped over the little gate
in the hedge and raced like a schoolboy across the
wide velvety lawns of the Barrington estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>He saw Nan and dear Miss Dahlia in the garden.
At his joyous shout, they both looked up and beheld
approaching them a tall lad who was jubilantly
waving his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Robert Widdemere!&rdquo; Nan said, and then,
as he came up and greeted them, she added, &ldquo;But
only yesterday I had a letter from you and in it
you said nothing about coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to surprise you, Lady Red Bird,&rdquo; the
lad exclaimed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it grand and glorious, Nan,
to be once more in this wonderful country. I wish
we could start right now for a ride up the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go today,&rdquo; the gypsy girl laughingly
told him, &ldquo;for I have something baking in the oven
and it cannot be left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could tend to it,&rdquo; Miss Dahlia said, but Nan
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a surprise for tomorrow,&rdquo; she merrily declared,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want even you, Aunt Dahlia, to
know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning happy eyes toward the lad, she said,
&ldquo;Think of it, Robert Widdemere, tomorrow will
be Thanksgiving day and five years since you and
I rode to the mountain top.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nan, comrade,&rdquo; the boy said eagerly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take
that ride again tomorrow, dressed gypsy-wise as
we were before, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish, Robert Widdemere,&rdquo; Nan laughingly
replied. &ldquo;Thanksgiving seems to be a fateful
day for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A happy hour the young people spent together.
Robert wished to hear all that happened and when
Nan protested that she had written every least little
thing, he declared that it had all been so interesting,
it would bear repeating.</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl sprang up, holding out both
hands as she exclaimed, &ldquo;Robert, I shall have to
ask you to come at some other time. I must look
after that something which is baking for tomorrow.&rdquo;
The lad caught the hands as he said, &ldquo;Good-bye, then,
I&rsquo;ll reappear at about ten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c33">CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE THANKSGIVING RIDE.</span></h2>
<p>Thanksgiving morning dawned gloriously, and
as Nan stood at her open window looking at the garden,
all aglow, at the gleaming blue sky and sea,
listening the while to the joyous song of a mocking
bird in a pepper tree near, she thought how truly
thankful she was that Fate had guided her to this
wonderful place on that long ago Autumn day.</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia, who with the passing months had
regained her strength, surprised the gypsy girl by
appearing in the kitchen before that maiden had
time to prepare the usual breakfast tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Nan darling,&rdquo; the little woman said as she
held out both hands. &ldquo;I am so thankful, so thankful
today that I have you. Think how dreary even
this beautiful world would be if I were alone in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>The girl, with sudden tears in her eyes, kissed
the little old lady lovingly as she replied, &ldquo;I am the
one who is most grateful. No mother could have
been kinder to an own child than you have been
to me.&rdquo; Then, brushing away a tear from the
wrinkled cheeks, she laughingly added, &ldquo;One
might think that we were bemoaning some calamity
instead of rejoicing because we have each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merrily assuming Norah&rsquo;s dialect, to make the
little old lady smile, Nan said, with arms akimbo,
&ldquo;Miss Dahlia, will ye be havin&rsquo; some cream of
wheat with thick yellow cream on it? Bobsy was
just this minute after lavin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was a happy breakfast after all, and
then, at ten o&rsquo;clock Robert appeared dressed in
gypsy fashion, and Nan, in her old costume of
crimson and gold, the color of Autumn leaves
in the sunshine, rode away with him on her pony
Binnie.</p>
<p>The lad seemed to be exuberantly happy, as side
by side, the two horses picked their way up the
rough mountain road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>When at last they could ride no further, they dismounted
and the lad turning to the girl said with
tender solicitude, &ldquo;Nan, every time that I glanced
back without speaking, I caught a sad or troubled
expression in your face. Won&rsquo;t you let me share
whatever it is that causes you new anxiety?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl flashed a radiant smile as she said self-rebukingly.
&ldquo;Truly, Robert, I have no real sorrow.
But I am thoughtful, I must confess, and quite
without willing it, I assure you. It is as though a
thought comes to me from somewhere from someone
else to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, knowing that she was not making herself
clearly understood, she asked abruptly, &ldquo;Robert,
do you believe in mental telepathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad nodded. &ldquo;I do indeed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Several
of us cadets at school tried the thing out and
the results were positively uncanny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with a questioning glance at the dark girl,
&ldquo;Why, Nan, do you believe that you are receiving
a telepathic communication?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I really don&rsquo;t know that I mean anything
half as high sounding as all that. But what I do
know is this. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where my thoughts
may start, they always wind up with wondering
where Manna Lou is. I am continually asking myself
a question which I cannot answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will Manna Lou be remembering that I am now
eighteen; indeed almost nineteen, and will she try
to locate me that she may keep her long-ago-made
promise to my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad looked into the dark eyes that were lifted
to his. &ldquo;Nan dear,&rdquo; he said very gently, &ldquo;would
you be greatly disappointed if this Manna Lou
should find you and if the tale she has to reveal,
should prove to be that you are not a gypsy girl
at all.&rdquo; This was very like the question he had
asked her in the long ago. Her answer had not
changed.</p>
<p>Clearly she looked back at him. &ldquo;Robert Widdemere,&rdquo;
she said unhesitatingly, &ldquo;all these years I
have believed my mother to be a gypsy, and I have
loved her as one. It would be very hard for me to
change the picture, O the beautiful, beautiful picture
I have in my heart of her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad, gazing into the glowing face could not
resist saying, &ldquo;Lady Red Bird, it is you who are
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nan, unlike many other girls, was not confused
by so direct a compliment. She replied simply.
&ldquo;I hope I am like my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>The lad could wait no longer to tell the dream
which had made his summer bright with hope.
&ldquo;Nan,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;nearly four years ago we stood
on this very rock looking down over the valley and
I asked you to let me be your brother-comrade.&rdquo;
Then, taking both of her hands, his voice trembling
with earnestness, he continued. &ldquo;And now, Nan, I
have brought you here to this same spot to ask
you to be my wife.&rdquo; Then, as she did not at once
reply, Robert hurried on, &ldquo;I know now that I loved
you, even then, but we were too young to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Robert Widdemere!&rdquo; the girl replied.
&ldquo;I too care for you, but I could not marry
you without your mother&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that answer, the lad had to be content.
After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Nan caught his arm and
pointed to the highway far below them. &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;years ago as we stood here, we saw a
strange car entering your grounds and in it was your
mother who separated us for so long; and today,
a strange car is entering the Barrington grounds.
Who do you suppose has come to pay us a visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one who can separate us again, Nan comrade,&rdquo;
the lad said earnestly, &ldquo;for no living creature
can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<h2 id="c34">CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br /><span class="small">A HAPPY SURPRISE.</span></h2>
<p>The gardener&rsquo;s boy came on a run to take Binnie
when Nan Barrington dismounted, and then the
girl holding out her hand to her companion said,
&ldquo;Good-bye, Robert Widdemere. I would ask you
to dine with us since it is Thanksgiving, but I know
that it is right that you should be with your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be over by mid-afternoon, Nan,&rdquo; the lad
earnestly replied, &ldquo;and I shall ask you again the
same question that I did this morning, but it will
be with my mother&rsquo;s consent. Good-bye, dear,
brave comrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Nan turned into the house, she noticed a handsome
car standing in the drive. For the moment,
she had forgotten the visitor about whom they had
wondered. Her heart was heavy with dread. What
if it were someone who had come to tell Miss Dahlia
about her lost fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>As she entered the wide hall, Miss Dahlia appeared
in the library door and beckoned to her, and so the
beautiful girl, dressed in crimson and gold, her
cheeks flushed, her dark eyes glowing, accompanied
her aunt, who seemed very much excited about
something.</p>
<p>A tall, elegant gentleman was standing near the
hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Alecsandri,&rdquo; the little lady said, &ldquo;this
is the gypsy girl for whom you are searching. This
is my Nan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unheeded the tears rolled down the wrinkled
cheeks of Miss Dahlia as the stranger, with evident
emotion, stepped forward, and held out both hands
to the wondering girl, &ldquo;And so you are Elenan, my
dear sister&rsquo;s little daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan looked, not only amazed, but distressed. &ldquo;Oh,
sir,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you are not a gypsy. My mother,
wasn&rsquo;t she a gypsy after all?&rdquo; Tears sprang to her
dark eyes and the hand which Miss Dahlia held was
trembling. The gentleman seemed surprised, but
the little old lady explained, &ldquo;Our Nan has been
picturing her mother and father all these years as
gypsies, and it is hard for her to change her thought
about them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>The man advanced and took the girl&rsquo;s hands, and
looking down at her earnestly, he said sincerely: &ldquo;I
am glad to find that you are not ashamed of your
father&rsquo;s people, for he truly was a gypsy. He was
Manna Lou&rsquo;s only brother. Now, if we may all
be seated I will tell you the story. Your mother
was born in a grey stone chateau overlooking the
Danube River. Our father died when she was
very young and our mother soon followed and so
my orphaned little sister was left to my care. I
thought that I was doing my best for her when I
had her instructed in languages and arts, and then,
just as she was budding into a charming and cultivated
young womanhood, I had her betrothed to
a descendant of Prince Couza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other Rumanian young ladies envied my sister
the social position which this alliance would give
her, but Elenan begged me not to coerce her to
marry a man whom she did not love. I was stern
and unrelenting. All too late I learned that my
sister loved Romola, a gypsy musician who was so
rarely gifted that as a boy he had often played at
the court for the king and queen. From them he
had received many favors. He was placed in a
monastery school to be educated, and, at his request,
his younger sister Manna Lou was placed in a
convent where she learned many things that other
girls of her race never knew, but when they were
old enough to do as they wished, gypsy fashion,
they returned to the roaming life which was all
that their ancestors had ever known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Often, Romola played the small harp he had
fashioned in the court of Prince Couza, and it was
there my sister met him. They loved each other
dearly and were secretly married. I was away in
another part of the country at the time, and, when
I returned they had been gone for a fortnight. I
searched everywhere for the gypsy band to which
Romola belonged, but no one knew where it had
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman looked thoughtfully at the girl
for a moment and then he continued: &ldquo;I never
fully abandoned the search, but, not knowing that
they had come to America, I followed clues that
led nowhere. I now know what happened. The
son of Queen Mizella, fearing arrest for some misdeed,
crossed the ocean to America and with them
was my sister disguised as a gypsy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But on the voyage over your father Romola sickened
and died. My poor sister was heart-broken and
lived only long enough to give birth to a daughter,
whom she left in the care of Manna Lou. She asked
that kind gypsy woman to bring you up as one of
her own band until you were eighteen. Then as
your mother knew, you would inherit her share of
the Alecsandri estate, and she asked Manna Lou, if
it were possible when you reached that age to take
you back to Rumania and to me. This, of course,
the faithful gypsy woman could not do, but, with
her band, she returned last summer and came to
tell me the story. I had long grieved over my sister&rsquo;s
loss not knowing to what desperation I had
driven her, and so I at once set sail for America in
search of her child. All that Manna Lou could tell
me was that you had left the caravan near San
Seritos, in California. When I arrived here and
made inquiries, I learned that a gypsy girl had been
adopted five years ago by Miss Barrington, and
now, my quest is ended. I have found my sister&rsquo;s
little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Nan could reply. Miss Dahlia, glancing
out of the window, exclaimed: &ldquo;Nan, darling, Robert
Widdemere is coming, and his mother is with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>The girl sprang up. &ldquo;Aunt Dahlia, Monsieur
Alecsandri, if you will excuse me, I will admit Mrs.
Widdemere and Robert. I would rather meet them
alone.&rdquo; And so, before the lad had time to lift
the heavy carved knocker, the door was opened by
Nan. After a rather formal greeting, she led them
into a small reception room.</p>
<p>It was hard for her to understand why Mrs.
Widdemere had come, and she still felt dazed because
of all she had so suddenly learned of her own
dear mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be seated?&rdquo; the girl heard herself
saying. Then to her surprise, Mrs. Widdemere,
who had always so disliked her, took both of her
hands, as she said &ldquo;Miss Barrington, can you ever
forgive me for the unkind way that I have treated
you? My son has been telling me what a splendid,
brave girl you are, and when I compare with you
the one I wanted him to marry, how sadly she is
found wanting. Only yesterday I received a letter
telling me that she had left her mother, who is in
deep sorrow, to accompany a party of gay friends
on a pleasure trip to Europe. You cannot think how
glad I am that my son did not heed my wishes in
this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Nan listened to this outburst, as one who could
hardly comprehend, and for a moment she did not
reply. Then she asked slowly, &ldquo;Mrs. Widdemere,
do I understand that you are now willing that your
son should marry a gypsy girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Barrington, Nan, what matters one&rsquo;s
ancestry when the descendants of noble families
are themselves so often ignoble? I have been a
vain, foolish woman, but I know that true worth
counts more than all else. If you can&rsquo;t forgive me,
because I wish it, then try to forgive me for the
sake of my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears gathered in the dark eyes of the girl, as
she said, &ldquo;Mrs. Widdemere, first I had a kind
gypsy-aunt, Manna Lou, then two dear adopted
aunts and no one could have been more loving than
they, but now, at last, I am to have someone whom
I can call &lsquo;mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you dear,&rdquo; the woman said, &ldquo;I shall try
to deserve so lovely and lovable a daughter. Robert,
my son, you and I are much to be congratulated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>The lad, who had been standing quietly near,
leaped forward and catching the hands of the girl
whom he loved, he said joyously. &ldquo;Nan, darling,
let&rsquo;s have our wedding tomorrow out under the
pepper tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled happily, and then, suddenly remembering
the waiting visitor, she said, &ldquo;Mrs.
Widdemere, I would like you and Robert to meet my
uncle, who has just arrived from Rumania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Rumanian gypsy,&rdquo; the lady was thinking, as
she followed the girl. &ldquo;That country is full of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, after greeting Miss Dahlia, she
saw an elegant gentleman approaching and heard
Nan saying, &ldquo;Mrs. Widdemere, may I present my
uncle, Monsieur Alecsandri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle, Nan?&rdquo; that lady exclaimed. &ldquo;Surely
this gentleman is not a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, madame, I am not, but I am proud
to be the uncle of this little gypsy girl.&rdquo; He placed
his hand lovingly on the dark head. &ldquo;Elenan is my
sister&rsquo;s child, but her father was Romola, one of
the handsomest and most talented of gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Then, that Robert and his mother might clearly
understand, the story was retold from the beginning.
The lad leaped forward, his hands outheld.
&ldquo;Oh Nan,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how glad you are that after
all you are a real gypsy.&rdquo; Then he thought of
something and turning toward the gentleman, he
said in his frank, winning way. &ldquo;Monsieur, Nan
and I were to have been married soon. May we
have your consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreigner, although surprised and perhaps
disappointed if he had hoped his sister&rsquo;s daughter
would return with him, was most gracious. &ldquo;If
the very kind woman with whom I find our Elenan
has given her permission, I also give mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were sudden tears in the gentle eyes of
the older woman. She had known of course, that
some day these two would wed, but now, how
could she live without Nan? Her hesitation was
barely noticeable, then she said bravely. &ldquo;I shall
be proud, indeed, to have Robert Widdemere for
a nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan, noting the quivering lips, took her benefactress
by the hand as she said brightly; &ldquo;Oh, Aunt
Dahlia, what do you think? I forgot our Thanksgiving
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t forget it!&rdquo; that little lady quite
herself again replied. &ldquo;Mrs. Sperry has been in our
kitchen all of the morning, and here she comes now
to announce that dinner is ready for us and our
three most welcomed guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s cup of joy seemed full to the over-flowing
but the day held for her still another happiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c35">CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><span class="small">AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL.</span></h2>
<p>On Thanksgiving afternoon Robert again said,
&ldquo;Nan, comrade, can&rsquo;t we be married tomorrow out
under our very own pepper tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; Mrs. Widdemere smilingly protested,
&ldquo;what an uncivilized suggestion for you to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very reason why I wish it,&rdquo; the lad
replied. &ldquo;Five years ago Nan and I met out under
that tree and we both declared that we wanted to be
uncivilized. I remember that I was pining to be a
wild Indian or a pirate, but instead, we have both
spent the intervening years in polishing our manners
and intellects.&rdquo; Then turning to the girl, he pleaded,
&ldquo;Lady Red Bird, let me have my own way just this
once, and then you may have your own way forever
after.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Nan laughed happily. &ldquo;But Robert,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;ought there not to be a trousseau before one is
married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elenan.&rdquo; It was Monsieur Alecsandri who was
speaking. &ldquo;I was so confident I would find you, that
I brought a trunk full of garments that were your
dear mother&rsquo;s. It was the trousseau which I had
provided for her when I betrothed her to a descendant
of Prince Couza. The gowns are the loveliest
that I could procure, but they were never worn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Basil.&rdquo; (He had asked the girl to
call him by his Christian name.) &ldquo;How glad I shall
be to have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Nan comrade,&rdquo; Robert repeated, &ldquo;you have
not yet said that I may plan our wedding and our
trip away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked at the lad who was seated on the
lounge at her side and said brightly, &ldquo;Robert, you
plan it all and let it be a surprise for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan noticed that during the hour that followed
Robert glanced at his watch and several times
walked toward the window and gazed out toward
the highway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so restless, son?&rdquo; his mother had
just inquired, when wheels were heard in the drive,
and soon after the call of the heavy iron knocker
resounded through the house. Robert half arose,
but sank back to the lounge when he saw Mrs.
Sperry going to the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; Little Miss Dahlia was quite
in a flutter, but Nan had heard a voice inquiring
if Miss Anne Barrington was at home?</p>
<p>With a cry of joy Nan sprang forward and held
the newcomer in a long and loving embrace. &ldquo;Phyllis,
I can&rsquo;t believe that it is you!&rdquo; she cried as she
stood back to survey the pretty, laughing face of her
dearest friend. &ldquo;Why, it seems too much like a
story book to be really true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she led the newcomer into the library where
she was gladly welcomed by all who knew her and
introduced by Nan to &ldquo;my uncle, Monsieur Alecsandri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis, who never had believed that her room-mate
was really a gypsy, took the arrival of an
aristocratic uncle quite as a matter of course, and
when they were all seated, Nan, still curious, exclaimed:
&ldquo;Do tell me how you happened to know
that it was time to come to my wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis looked up at Robert with a mischievous
twinkle in her blue eyes. &ldquo;Shall I tell?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell,&rdquo; that lad replied. &ldquo;Last week I wired
my fair cousin to board a train at once for the West
if she wished to attend our wedding which I hoped
would be solemnized on Thanksgiving day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert! How could you invite a guest to our
wedding before you had asked me to marry you?&rdquo;
Nan laughingly declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was rather presumptuous,&rdquo; the lad confessed,
&ldquo;but all&rsquo;s well that ends well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur Alecsandri accepted Miss Barrington&rsquo;s
invitation to remain in her home, and Phyllis spent
the night with Nan, for they had much to talk about.
The latter maiden often fell to wondering what
Robert&rsquo;s surprising plan was for their wedding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<h2 id="c36">CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><span class="small">NAN&rsquo;S TROUSSEAU.</span></h2>
<p>The wedding day dawned gloriously. The two
girls were up early and as soon as they were dressed,
Nan drew her friend to the wide open window and
they looked out at the garden, where masses of yellow
chrysanthemums were glowing in the sunlight.
Beyond, the wide silvery beach was glistening, and,
over the gleaming blue water a flock of shining
white sea gulls dipped and circled. Silently the two
girls stood with arms about each other, and, in
memory, Nan was again in the long ago. She was
watching two children dressed in gypsy garb as
they stood near the rushing, singing fountain. One
was a dark, eager-eyed girl of thirteen, and the
other was a mis-shapen, goblin-like boy of ten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Tirol, dear little Tirol. How he had loved her,
how he had clung to her! Tears gathered in the
girl&rsquo;s eyes as she thought of the little fellow and
she hoped that, somehow he might know what a
happy day this was to be for his dear Sister Nan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; Phyllis laughingly exclaimed,
&ldquo;Here comes a mounted messenger at full speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bobsy, the gardener&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; Nan said. &ldquo;He
has been for an early ride on my Binnie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, chancing to see the two girls at the upper
window, waved a letter, and, believing that he
wished to give it to them, they went downstairs and
out on the veranda.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s freckled face was beaming. &ldquo;Mr. Robert
sent this over,&rdquo; he said jubilantly, &ldquo;and he gave
me a five dollar gold piece toward my new bicycle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Then away the boy galloped to tell this astounding
news to his mother, while Nan opened the letter
and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning to you, Lady Red Bird. Can you
believe it? This is our wedding day! I want to
shout and sing, but I have much to do before that
most wonderful of all hours, today at high noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you promised that I might plan everything,
I am asking my Nan to be dressed in gypsy fashion.
Then your kinsfolk and my kinsfolk are to meet
under the pepper tree as the bells of the old mission
tell the hour of noon. Last night as I went through
the hedge, I told our tree the great honor that was
to befall it, and this morning the birds in it are singing
a riotous song of joy, and I am sure that the
pepper berries are redder than ever before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, at two o&rsquo;clock will come the real surprise
and the beginning of our joyous journey. Nan
comrade, may I prove worthy of you!</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Your</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Robert</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After breakfast Aunt Dahlia, Phyllis and Nan
were wondering what the bride would wear for a
wedding gown, when Monsieur Alecsandri returned
from the station, whither he had gone at an early
hour. A few moments later an expressman brought
a trunk which was carried to Nan&rsquo;s room. Then
her uncle Basil smilingly handed her a key as he
said: &ldquo;Elenan, do me the honor of wearing one of
the gowns that were prepared for your mother&rsquo;s
wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan was indeed puzzled to know how she could
please her uncle Basil, and yet keep her promise to
Robert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>When the trunk was opened and the garments
which it contained had been spread about on bed,
lounge and chairs, Nan turned to the older lady,
her dark eyes aglow as she said, &ldquo;Aunt Dahlia, dear,
did you ever see fabrics more beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is especially lovely,&rdquo; the little lady
said as she smoothed the folds of a soft, white silk.
&ldquo;I wish you would try it on, dearie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, when the girl stood arrayed in the
gown, Phyllis exclaimed, &ldquo;Nan, that surely was
made for your wedding dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Phyllis, you are forgetting Robert&rsquo;s request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; the other maid laughingly replied.
Then for a moment she looked about the
room thoughtfully. Spying the gorgeous scarlet
and gold shawl, which in the long ago Manna Lou
had given the girl, she took it and threw one fringed
corner over Nan&rsquo;s left shoulder, fastening it in
front at the belt. Then, winding it about her waist,
another point hung panelwise to the bottom of her
skirt. The spangled yellow silk handkerchief was
twined about the dark hair, and the picture reflected
in the mirror was truly a beautiful one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tres charmante!&rdquo; Phyllis exclaimed jubilantly.
&ldquo;Now, let me see, there should be something old
and something new, something borrowed and something
blue. The dress is new, to us anyway; that
gorgeous shawl is old. I&rsquo;ll loan you a handkerchief
with a yellow and crimson border, and now,
what shall you wear that is blue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dahlia slipped from the room to return a
moment later with a velvet box which she handed
to the girl she so loved. &ldquo;My mother gave it to me
when I was eighteen,&rdquo; the little lady said, &ldquo;and I
want to give it to my Nan on her wedding day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark head and the fair bent eagerly over the
box and when the cover was removed, the two girls
uttered exclamations of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely, lovely!&rdquo; Phyllis cried as she
lifted a sapphire necklace and clasped it about the
throat of the happy Nan.</p>
<p>A busy morning was spent by the two girls, and,
as it neared noon, Nan resplendently arrayed, looked
up at Phyllis as she said, &ldquo;I wonder where Aunt
Dahlia is. She hasn&rsquo;t been here for half an hour
past. Perhaps she is in her room. Wait dear,
and I will see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Miss Barrington&rsquo;s door was closed. Nan, after
tapping, softly opened it. Miss Dahlia, with folded
hands, was seated by the wide window gazing out
at the sea and in her sweet grey eyes there was such
a wistful loneliness. She looked up, as the girl entered,
and smiled faintly, then her lips quivered and
the tears came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Dahlia, darling! How selfish I have
been!&rdquo; Nan cried, as heedless of her white silk
dress, she knelt by the little woman and put her arms
lovingly about her. &ldquo;I never thought! Perhaps
you didn&rsquo;t want me to get married. But it isn&rsquo;t too
late, Aunt Dahlia, if you do not wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little girl,&rdquo; the old lady said tenderly, &ldquo;of
course I want you to be married. If I had searched
the world over, I could not have chosen a lad
whom I would like better. It is I who am selfish.
I was fearing that Robert would take you away,
and I don&rsquo;t want to lose my Nan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose me, Aunt Dahlia? Do you think that I
would let you lose me? You are dearer to me than
all the world, and where I go, you shall go, but
we will always come back, won&rsquo;t we dearie, back
to our garden-all-aglow where we have been so
happy. Hark, the first stroke of the mission bells
is telling that it is noon, and we must not be late
at our very own wedding. Yes, Phyllis we are
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Monsieur Alecsandri was waiting for them in the
library. Together they started along the flower
bordered path toward the pepper tree, and Nan&rsquo;s
wedding music was the joyous song of the birds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c37">CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br /><span class="small">NAN&rsquo;S WEDDING.</span></h2>
<p>The ceremony was a simple one, but the solemnity,
which Mrs. Widdemere feared would be absent,
seemed to be enhanced by the peaceful beauty
of the surroundings. All was hushed, not a bird
sang nor a breeze stirred as reverently the two, arrayed
as gypsies spoke the sacred words that made them
man and wife. Then, when the rector from St.
Martin&rsquo;s-by-the-Sea had kissed the bride and congratulated
the radiant Robert, he departed, leaving
the kinsfolk alone. Nan turned first of all toward
the little old lady in the silvery grey gown, who was
smiling through tears, and she said joyously, &ldquo;Aunt
Dahlia darling, instead of losing your gypsy girl
you have gained a gypsy boy.&rdquo; Then going to
Mrs. Widdemere, Nan kissed her affectionately and
said very softly, &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; Then turning to Monsieur
Alecsandri she asked gayly, &ldquo;Uncle Basil, what
do you think of your nephew? Is he not a good
looking Romany rye?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>That stately gentleman shook hands with Robert
as he replied: &ldquo;In Rumania there is not one who
can excel him in manliness, and I know that he
will care for my dear sister&rsquo;s little girl as I would
wish her cared for. I am indeed thankful, Elenan,
that I arrived in time for your wedding. This
afternoon I shall start on my homeward journey,
hoping that in another year my niece and nephew,
Mrs. Widdemere and Miss Barrington, will honor
me with a long visit.&rdquo; Then he added earnestly,
&ldquo;Elenan, always remember that your mother&rsquo;s birthplace
on the Danube River is as much your home
as it is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Widdemere invited them through the
gate in the hedge and, to their surprise, there on
the other side, still under the spreading branches of
the great old pepper tree, was a bare board table on
which an appetizing lunch was spread gypsy-wise.</p>
<p>It was one o&rsquo;clock when the feast was over. Robert,
for a moment alone with Nan, said softly,
&ldquo;Little wife, put on that old gypsy dress now, for
at two we will start on our trip away for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>The girl looked up with a radiant smile as she
said, &ldquo;It shall be done, my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intervening hour was a busy one, for Monsieur
Alecsandri took his departure, and then Nan,
with the help of Phyllis, packed the few things she
would need. Hearing a soft footfall back of her,
the gypsy girl whirled about and caught Miss Barrington
in her arms and held her in a long, loving
embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy, Aunt Dahlia, so happy,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and just think what I would have missed from my
life if you had not wanted to keep that wild little
gothlin five years ago. I would never have had you
to love, nor my best friend,&rdquo; the girl hesitated, and
then with laughing eyes she added, &ldquo;nor my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; Phyllis said. &ldquo;I hear tinkling bells outside.
What can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gypsy van,&rdquo; Nan cried joyfully, &ldquo;and Robert
is driving. That is the surprise and surely a delightful
one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p><a href="#front" id="rfront">Five minutes later these two joyful gypsies started
away in a covered wagon,</a>
two horses in the lead,
and Binnie, and Robert&rsquo;s saddle horse, Firefly,
trailing behind. Phyllis was to remain with Aunt
Dahlia during the fortnight and together they
stood on the veranda waving until the gypsy van
had turned into the highway. Nan looked up at the
driver as she said happily, &ldquo;Robert, this is a wonderful
surprise.&rdquo; Then she added with sudden
wistfulness, &ldquo;I wish Manna Lou might have been
at our wedding, but Uncle Basil promised to tell
her all about it and give her my grateful love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were slowly ascending the mountain road,
and, when they reached the ridge, Robert drew to
one side and stopped. &ldquo;Nan comrade,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I want to climb to the top, for, somehow, it
seems as though that peak must be our shrine for
thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when they reached the boulder where they
had stood twice before, the lad took both of the
girl&rsquo;s hands and looking into the dark glowing eyes,
he said, &ldquo;Elenan may be a fine Rumanian lady, if
she wishes, but the comrade whom I love and always
shall love is my dear, brave little wife, Gypsy
Nan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Then together, hand in hand, they went down
the trail and soon the tinkling of bells was heard
as the gypsy van slowly crossed over the ridge
and down another mountain road, where, at sunset,
these two would make camp in a picturesque canyon
called Happy Valley.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p class="pg">1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p class="pg">1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p class="pg">1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p class="pg">1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p class="pg">This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

<p class="pg">1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p class="pg">1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3 class="pg">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3 class="pg">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p class="pg">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p class="pg">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
